What are the latest thoughts on refusing to switch seats,especially when there's retaliation?

I was on an aisle of a 4 seat section,and the guy next to me asked if I would switch with his wife,who was in the row ahead of us,in a middle seat. I declined,as I tend to be a somewhat anxious flyer(i dont show it,but I do need aisle access) and i reserved my seat 2 months ago. The guy was disgusted of course(the guy on the aisle seat next to the wife must also have refused) and proceeded to sit the entire flight with his legs in a V-position,leaving his left leg halfway under the seat in front of me.He also threw his blanket all over him so that it came into my seat(which i picked up and put over the side of his armrest-no fuss,just removed it from my lap) and stood in the aisle when i went to the restroom once and refused to let me back into my seat b/c ""he needed to stand."" I could have went to an FA,but it was a 6 hour flight and I didnt want any more issues. Plus I knew there was nowhere else to be moved. Thoughts?? Also,it was definitely a rude guy flight-the passenger in front of me reclined his seat ALL the way back(which is their right,I know,so i did the same)and complained to me that I was bumping the back of his seat everytime I moved around in my seat or got into my bag(which I did once or twice). I did tell him that if he pulled his seat forward he might not notice me as much,but he kept it where it was. Needless to say,the flight was just peachy.

My wife and I just returned from a round trip via Delta from Charlotte to Jacksonville, FL. We flew first class cheaper than a coach seat on AA. From the moment we stepped up to the ticket counter in Charlotte until we got our baggage back at the end of the trip, it was amazing to experience the difference in service. The comparison between first class on Delta and first class on AA is amazing. Delta on each leg had chilled water bottles waiting at our seat, fresh blankets, pillows, and the flight attendants came down the aisle and took drink orders on the ground, and seamlessly replaced empty water bottles. Snacks were first rate and included fresh fruit and unique offerings. The entire crew was dressed very sharply, smiled, and actually thanked us for flying with them. They seemed to genuinely enjoy their jobs. Every flight on AA that we've taken since the merger we could hear the flight attendants complaining and they could care less about the service. Not once did passengers get berated by the flight attendants to hurry up so they could have an on time departure by the Delta crews....it is common place on AA. It was as if we stepped back in time when air travel was enjoyable. On each leg of the trip, our luggage was waiting on us when we arrived at baggage claim.

They seemed to genuinely enjoy their jobs. Every flight on AA that we've taken since the merger we could hear the flight attendants complaining and they could care less about the service. Not once did passengers get berated by the flight attendants to hurry up so they could have an on time departure by the Delta crews....it is common place on AA. It was as if we stepped back in time when air travel was enjoyable. On each leg of the trip, our luggage was waiting on us when we arrived at baggage claim. AA is lucky to get it to you within 30 minutes. Best decision we've made to switch our business to Delta.","[Since Usairways merger with American our service and prices have suffered out of Charlotte. My last experience made me vow to never fly them unless I absolutely had to. My wife and I just returned from a round trip via Delta from Charlotte to Jacksonville, FL. We flew first class cheaper than a coach seat on AA. From the moment we stepped up to the ticket counter in Charlotte until we got our baggage back at the end of the trip, it was amazing to experience the difference in service. The comparison between first class on Delta and first class on AA is amazing.

8,4,1,1,1581,"I recently returned from 3 weeks in Europe after flying with BA a few times and just wanted to share my experiences I had with the airline. ---- from YVR to LHR: Departed on time, arrived at LHR 20 minutes early. I paid about $100 extra for an exit row seat (28J) and couldn't recommend this more. The seat is located in the first row in Economy, right behind Club World. After takeoff, they close the curtain and due to there being no toilets here, there's no one walking around to disturb you. My seat was right beside the door which kind of protrudes out. This was used as my leg rest for the entire duration of the flight. If you can't afford Premium Economy, this is a really great option. Dinner was a choice of pasta (with feta and tomatoes) or chicken (with rice and veggies). I had the pasta which was actually quite tasty - by no means a five star meal, but not bad for plane food. The chocolate dessert was delicious. After dinner service, lights went out and it was time to sleep. A word of warning - it's extremely cold by the exits. I had a blanket and jacket but I was still shivering throughout the entire flight. In hindsight, I'm not sure why I didn't ask for an extra blanket - I must have been delirious with sleep... Breakfast is served about an hour before landing. It consisted of a fruit muffin, yogurt, and a box of raisins (?!). Not very filling, but oh well. IFE was average - I only watched one movie before going to sleep. The new releases were nothing to get excited about, so it may be wise to bring your own entertainment. BA85 from LHR to YVR: My experience on this flight was similar to the above, except this time I had seat 29K. This is also an exit row seat but in the second row of economy with a missing seat in front which allows you to enter the aisle by walking in front (and not over your seat mates). It was a good seat but not as good as any of the exit row seats in row 28 which just feel more spacious. This flight departed a bit late and arrived 45 minutes late at YVR. I also flew from LHR to BCN (BA486), and AMS to LHR (BA435) on their smaller planes. Both plane interiors looked brand spanking new. I managed to score exit row seats on both these fights as well which was a nice bonus even though the flights were quite short in duration. There's no IFE but they do serve a small snack and free drinks on both flights. I don't know what the snacks were as I declined them on both flights. Overall, a very good experience with BA. They're definitely my airline of choice when flying to, from, and within Europe, especially if I can get an exit row seat on the international flights.

Any domestic travel included in your ticket will probably be on South African airline Comair, operating under the British Airways banner. BA/Comair has a “policy” (it happened on both of my flights) of selecting passengers at random and asking them to leave their hand luggage at the door when boarding, as “the cabin is full”. Don’t do it. I did, and had a phone stolen from my bag. When the crew approached me at the door, I asked them if they would stow the bag on board, meaning in the cabin. They said they would. Instead, I ended up collecting my unlocked bag of valuables (minus one) from the carousel in the terminal. To add insult to injury, my bag was well within the regulation size, it fitted comfortably into the overhead locker (on the return trip) and it was all unnecessary as there was plenty of room in the lockers anyway. When I complained to BA at the airport I was told I should not have left valuables in my checked-in luggage!

In a story from this morning, the Morning Herald says ""water from the blocked drain collected in a drip tray under the floor.

David Cox, Qantas' executive general manager responsible for engineering, tells The Australian ""it was just like tipping a glass of water into your stereo."" Dr. Arvind Sinha, director of aerospace at RMIT University in Melbourne, explains to the Morning Herald that ""the engines have their own independent power source and the steering is operated by a hydraulic pump system, but the critical issues are the navigation and communication systems that you need to find your way to a runway to land."" Colin Adams of the Australian and International Pilot's Association says the Qantas crew and passengers were ""lucky"" that the plane was not far out over open water when the incident occurred, according to the London Daily Mail. ""In that situation you have a minimum of 30 minutes before you lose power to the flight instruments,"" Adams tells the Morning Herald. ""After that the only idea that you have of airspeed and where you are in relation to what's around you is what you can see out of the window. There is no written procedure for what happens in that situation -- it's the pilot and his wits. If you were a long way from an airfield at night it would be an extremely hazardous situation.

Although only 20% of services will be lost within the next year, EasyJet are still selling tickets as normal through the winter season with no route or frequency cuts at all other than Manchester and schedules still show early morning departures and late night arrivals in Madrid, which shows that aircraft is based there. Why are they still selling these flights when us who take only little interest in the aviation industry know they won't happen but others less so will not? I'd say for the time being people DO NOT BOOK EASYJET FLIGHTS TO/FROM MADRID POST OCTOBER 2012 AS THERE'S A CHANCE IT MAY NOT FLY! Give it a couple of weeks or so unless anything happens before hand.

We flew Christchurch NZL to Narita Airport, Tokyo via the Gold Coast Airport. The flights were on time going over, no issues with delays or connections. The flight was delayed an hour coming back, but apart from that we had no issues with onwards connections, lost bags etc. The planes were lovely and service great. The thing that impressed us most was regarding our request to have luggage on the way back. We had booked a while back when they had a 2:1 special (2 fly for price of 1). We booked our basic flights ex Chch. Over the next few weeks we got several emails changing details of our flight. For the most part these were tiny changes: change of terminal, flights changing times by 5-10 minutes (in our favour), however, one of the changes was canning the return flight to Chch and putting us on a flight to Auckland, then a domestic flight to Chch. We didn't have any choice but to accept this as our trip was on quite a tight timeframe. Later we decided that we wanted to have one person with 10kg baggage on the way back to allow for a few souvenirs we planned to get. When we went to do this online, we found that it would cost us $98 (which we were prepared to pay) plus $15 more because of the domestic flight we now had through the change to their scheduling. We decided to wait until the airport and ask them there to waive the $15 as it was not our choice to do that leg. The lady at the airport counter spent quite a bit of time going through our booking history, then she handed us our boarding passes and said no problem. I pulled out my cc to pay for the Narita-AKL baggage and she said there was no charge for that either. We had asked for one person to have 10kg and she loaded 15kg baggage on both our tickets for free. We thought that was pretty good and were happy with that!

We booked our basic flights ex Chch. Over the next few weeks we got several emails changing details of our flight. For the most part these were tiny changes: change of terminal, flights changing times by 5-10 minutes (in our favour), however, one of the changes was canning the return flight to Chch and putting us on a flight to Auckland, then a domestic flight to Chch. We didn't have any choice but to accept this as our trip was on quite a tight timeframe. Later we decided that we wanted to have one person with 10kg baggage on the way back to allow for a few souvenirs we planned to get. When we went to do this online, we found that it would cost us $98 (which we were prepared to pay) plus $15 more because of the domestic flight we now had through the change to their scheduling. We decided to wait until the airport and ask them there to waive the $15 as it was not our choice to do that leg. The lady at the airport counter spent quite a bit of time going through our booking history, then she handed us our boarding passes and said no problem. I pulled out my cc to pay for the Narita-AKL baggage and she said there was no charge for that either. We had asked for one person to have 10kg and she loaded 15kg baggage on both our tickets for free. We thought that was pretty good and were happy with that! When we got onto the Gold Coast-Auckland leg of our return flight we discovered we had exit row seats and then when the food trolley came round, the hostess informed us we each had $10 voucher for food. This was our first time flying long haul with a LCC. Even without the freebies we got as compensation for the change of return flight, we found it a good experience and would happily fly Jetstar long haul again out of NZ/Australia.]",2400,2400,0,0

8,4,1,1,1780,"My partner and I recently flew back from Barcelona to Heathrow with BA. The flight was delayed by 2.5 hours, resulting in our getting into Heathrow after midnight, when all public transport other than taxis had ceased running. During the flight, we were told on two occasions by crew that if passengers were to take a taxi home, this would be refunded in full by the airline on presentation of a receipt. On arrival, we received a quote from a London black cab for £85-90 to North London. This would normally be an excessive expense for us, but as it was 12.30am we took the taxi in order to get home quickly (and in the understanding that reimbursement would be forthcoming). The final fare ended up being £97. However, on making a claim and presenting our taxi receipt, we were informed by BA's Customer Relations department that we would only be refunded £50 as the full amount was considered 'beyond reasonable' and it would be 'unfair to other customers' to make an exception. After querying this further - and stressing that passengers were explicitly told that they would be 'fully' refunded for any taxi journeys - we finally learnt (via a response from the airline's Twitter account!) that the maximum compensation given for transport is £50. I wondered if any others have experienced something similar? I think it's fair to say that we and the other passengers were misled by BA, who promised something only to fail to deliver, leaving us considerably out of pocket. They also appear to be completely oblivious to the actual cost of a standard taxi from Heathrow to London! If anybody has any suggestions on alternative channels for proceeding with this, it would be much appreciated. I have already considered raising it with the CAA. ----","[My partner and I recently flew back from Barcelona to Heathrow with BA. ]The flight was delayed by 2.5 hours, resulting in our getting into Heathrow after midnight, when all public transport other than taxis had ceased running.

Here it is: I have friends and family members who can't or won't be bothered to mail presents (and money is not the problem). They save them up for when I visit and then give them to me then, expecting me to take them back on the plane. Sometimes these gifts are quite bulky; and, as I travel lightly (almost always without checked luggage, and usually with just a back-pack), they never fit into my luggage. On one occasion I ended up checking my backpack to bring the present on board as a carry-on; on another occasion, a family member mailed me the present (and didn't tell the giver that she was doing this). I've kind of had it, and would frankly prefer not to receive anything rather than have to pay $25 to check luggage or put another family member out.

I disputed the o/b and went through the maths with the woman on the phone who couldn't understand what I was saying and was in a bloody call centre in India and who said that she'd escalate my complaint to a manager who'd call tomorrow...cue more ranting from me that today was the last day to pay the o/b and that a phone call tomorrow would be useless if she was saying that I'd lose the holiday if it wasn't paid off today. I asked to be transferred through to the sales team as she was in the customer services team and seemingly in a differennt country! After being put on hold for a while an English sounding guy came on the line, asking what the problem was..at this point I'm in tears as I'm so stressed out and he tells me ""You won't lose the holiday as you're talking to me now. You called us, it's fine. Your tickets have been dispatched anyway"". He says that the price of the holiday may have gone up and didn't I get any emails from the woman who booked it for me bk in October. I haven't heard from here since the day I bloody booked it!!!!!! I tell him how I was told that the taxes would not be rising again and how I'd budgeted down to the last penny for what I believed I owed. He gave me this agents direct line telling me she'd be in tomorrow 9:00-5:30pm and that she knew more about the booking and would be able to help me. I'm so angry at this shoddy service from Travelocity. You can't go adding money onto peoples outstanding balances without informing them beforehand!!! I lost my job recently so money is tight at the moment and to say I'm still shaking with anger is not an exaggeration! I was in bloody tears to the guy on the phone. I'm so stressed out at the moment. ]They can't do this again can they??? They'd have the call on tape where I was told in no terms would the taxes be rising again.. I wasn't even told by the lady in India where the additional £30 had come from!!!!!!!! [Will be ringing the lady who booked the trip for me first thing tomorrow morning but would appreciate any advice if possible. Many thanks for reading my rant ....*and breathe*]",3318,3102,0.0650994575,0

I booked and paid for 3 flights with Easy Jet prior to our departure. The first two flights were uneventful. However our last flight from Athens to London ended up blowing my holiday budget out of the water. We were booked on an Olympic Air flight out of Paros in the Greek Islands a flight that is 20 minutes in length and was scheduled to depart at 16.05pm. Our Easy Jet Connection was due to depart at 19.00 and check in closed at 18.20. Due to the late incoming plane to Paros we did not arrive in at Athens airport until 17.55pm and we were promptly transferred to the terminal by an awaiting bus and were in the terminal at 18.00. I advised my wife and children to go and retrieve the bags and I raced up to the Easy Jet counter to commence check in. By the time I got to the counter it was 18.18pm on my watch and on the clocks in the terminal but there were no Easy Jet staff at the check in at all. The next day there was an Air Traffic Controllers strike that had been scheduled and we had non-refundable accommodation and other paid activities in London. I went looking for the Easy Jet representative in the Terminal who advised that as it was at that stage, 18.21pm by her watch the flight had closed, there were no staff available and there was nothing she could do other than advise us that due to industrial action and bookings we would not be likely to get paid seats with Easy Jet for 3 days. Faced with this I looked for flights departing to London that night and found a British Airways flight due to depart at 19.10. I was advised by a BA representative that she may be able to get 5 seats but would not know until 18.40. She managed to get 5 economy seats for which I was charged in excess of EURO2500 or Australian $3557.00. I spoke to BA the next day in London and a staff member told me that I was charged adult fares for the two children under 12 and that I should be entitled to a 25% refund. The battle to do this is still going on with the BA refunds section and the initial response that I received when the matter was referred to BA customer relations was that BA only have 2 classes of economy seats adult and infant ie 2 and under. There website would suggest otherwise. I have written to Easy Jet and am awaiting a response and will detail it in this forum when it is to hand. I think the moral of this story is that allow the widest possible berth between connection if travelling on a discount carrier. Do not accept the check in closure time will be adhered to by staff of a budget carrier and make sure that you have travel insurance that covers the scenario of a missed connection, as many policies in this regard will only give you a limited amount in very limited circumstances.

I went looking for the Easy Jet representative in the Terminal who advised that as it was at that stage, 18.21pm by her watch the flight had closed, there were no staff available and there was nothing she could do other than advise us that due to industrial action and bookings we would not be likely to get paid seats with Easy Jet for 3 days. Faced with this I looked for flights departing to London that night and found a British Airways flight due to depart at 19.10. I was advised by a BA representative that she may be able to get 5 seats but would not know until 18.40. She managed to get 5 economy seats for which I was charged in excess of EURO2500 or Australian $3557.00. I spoke to BA the next day in London and a staff member told me that I was charged adult fares for the two children under 12 and that I should be entitled to a 25% refund. The battle to do this is still going on with the BA refunds section and the initial response that I received when the matter was referred to BA customer relations was that BA only have 2 classes of economy seats adult and infant ie 2 and under. There website would suggest otherwise. I have written to Easy Jet and am awaiting a response and will detail it in this forum when it is to hand. I think the moral of this story is that allow the widest possible berth between connection if travelling on a discount carrier. Do not accept the check in closure time will be adhered to by staff of a budget carrier and make sure that you have travel insurance that covers the scenario of a missed connection, as many policies in this regard will only give you a limited amount in very limited circumstances. I will keep you all posted. ------- Sydney]",2926,198,0.9323308271,1

As far as I can tell, both airlines use Terminal 1. My question is: will we be classed as transit passengers and therefore be able to use the transit hotel?

So I called the call center and was told that they had no information about luggage allowance and that it would be printed on my tickets. Now is the time to pay the balance and I have again enquired about baggage to be told its only 15Kgs and even worse that I selected this allowance when booking. This is crazy !!!. I have checked the online booking form today and you can clearly see the baggage allowance. This must have changed. can anyone help me !!

8,4,1,1,2270,"I appreciate that there are still alot of stranded people out there and I hope you all get home soon. but here was our story. I thought it best to wait 'till we all got home so we can give hopefully a balanced perspective of events. We were due to fly home on 15th April, when it all first happened from Atlanta. We were about 250 miles from the airport, just waking up in our hotel room when we heard the news on CNN, and obviously devastated. It was more the ""not knowing"" than anything else. The website (BA) told us not to go to the airport, and it was about 2.5 hours to speak to someone on the phone. We had to go and return the rental car anyway at ATL so had some hours to calm down and think a bit, rather than turn up to check in totally unaware and panic. The news in the U.S on this was fairly low key at the time from what we saw, and we got more information by logging on to UK news websites, it really felt like doom and gloom from what the media were saying. On our arrival at check in, we handed in my pre printed boarding passes to the BA check in staff, and decided just to book ourselves on the next available flight out, which was 6 days later. Again feeling devastated by the wait and potential additional expense that wasn't budgeted for (or so we thought). The kids were upset, the wife too, however ""keep calm"" I said to myself, trying to hold it all together ,as there is nothing you can do. BA check in staff were truely exceptional, along with ATL dispatchers for the flight (BA226 ATL-LHR on 15th Apr '10). Although they could not doing anything about the flight, their service went beyond the call of duty in terms of help, advice, and being put up in a hotel nearby with all meals paid for. BA, the hotel staff, ATL staff, and the British Consulate in downtown all worked together for the benefit of the passengers. All of them worked 110% to help us, and it will never be forgotten. I was aware of the other horror stories from other airlines just ""dumping"" their passengers with little more than $7 per day to survive on. We remember a group of 4/5 parent helpers looking after 20 or so kids who were representing the UK in a robotic tournament in Atlanta flying on an American airline who had to start paying out of their own pockets. I hope you got back safely if you're reading this. We also rememberd at the consulate, another passenger ""dumped"" by another European airline, with no one to talk to, speak to, or given any advice until the Consulate stepped in. There are hundreds more I know, and we are lucky to be what I think are the fortunate few who flew on BA. I'm not one to hype up BA, as I had some reservations on flying with them, but after this experience, and if I ever decide to fly again then there will only be 1 airline to choose from. I hope everyone can receive some form of recompense. Up to then my faith in British society had been strained to say the least, but this experience is something I'll never forget, that yes there are people out there who care and want to make a difference. I hope everyone out there still gets home safely and quickly.","I appreciate that there are still alot of stranded people out there and I hope you all get home soon. but here was our story.

I hope everyone out there still gets home safely and quickly.","[I appreciate that there are still alot of stranded people out there and I hope you all get home soon. but here was our story. I thought it best to wait 'till we all got home so we can give hopefully a balanced perspective of events. We were due to fly home on 15th April, when it all first happened from Atlanta. We were about 250 miles from the airport, just waking up in our hotel room when we heard the news on CNN, and obviously devastated. It was more the ""not knowing"" than anything else. The website (BA) told us not to go to the airport, and it was about 2.5 hours to speak to someone on the phone. We had to go and return the rental car anyway at ATL so had some hours to calm down and think a bit, rather than turn up to check in totally unaware and panic. The news in the U.S on this was fairly low key at the time from what we saw, and we got more information by logging on to UK news websites, it really felt like doom and gloom from what the media were saying. On our arrival at check in, we handed in my pre printed boarding passes to the BA check in staff, and decided just to book ourselves on the next available flight out, which was 6 days later. Again feeling devastated by the wait and potential additional expense that wasn't budgeted for (or so we thought). The kids were upset, the wife too, however ""keep calm"" I said to myself, trying to hold it all together ,as there is nothing you can do. BA check in staff were truely exceptional, along with ATL dispatchers for the flight (BA226 ATL-LHR on 15th Apr '10).

This is for all applications lodged *on or after* this date. Remember if you use a passport acceptance office (like a US post office) or one of the regional Department of State Passport Offices, it's the date on which you actually file or submit your application that will determine the fee matrix. If you are eligible to, and use regular US Mail for submission, it's the post mark date that will govern. Note that the one of the biggest increases (expressed as percentage) is in the additional page insert fee, which goes from *free* to $82 per insert added. Here's the entire new fee matrix from the DoS' Passport Services page: travel.state.gov/passport/fees/fees_5079.html If your passport is going to expire soon, will have less than 6 months validity, or you need to add extra pages, this would be an *excellent* time to do so, before the new fee matrix becomes applicable.

After reporting the problem via their website, I searched the internet to find all kinds of horrible results to similar situations including having to repurchase the ticket (without refund) at the current going rate. The current rate is now $500 more than it was a week ago! I would like to thank Shirley from International Reservations for her diligent persistence in helping me to correct a name error. Without her help, I would still be worrying whether TSA would allow my mother to fly with the ticket on which I incorrectly entered my last name instead of hers. Shirley was great and fixed the problem with no issue. She was polite during the entire transaction and gave me updates along the way so I would feel comfortable on hold. Thanks again for her help.

8,4,1,1,2366,"Yesterday I flew home from Jeddah via Doha on Qater Airways. On boarding the flight from Doha to Manchester it was quite chaotic in the forward economy cabin of the Airbus A330. Numerous families had unilaterally decided to seat themselves together regardless of their seat assignments. The poor FA spent 15 mins trying to get people into their correct seats. I reserved my usual aisle seat, but I had now been moved into a central aisle seat rather than my usual window aisle seat. I would hazard a guess this occurred to try and keep a family on the same row if possible, no big deal to be honest. However in my row was a mother and 2 children. The father of the family demanded rather than ask that I change seats with him, now if he'd been seated in business then fair enough, even accounting for his rather rude attitude. However he was seated in a centre seat behind me, I told him sorry but I dislike to being trapped in. He then became extremely rude, at which point I reported him to the FA. The FA had a word with him and he went off in Huff to his seat. Several hours later his young son looked at me and said "" your the nasty bl@@dy man who wouldn't move"" I guess that comment says it all really, clearly such language shouldn't come from a 3 yr old child. I have moved before to try and assist a family, as long as it's a similar seat close by then that's fine. This rather rude incident will definitely give me pause for thought in future. I think it was the overriding rude sense of entitlement that annoyed me.

Nobody was there to do the checkin for transit passengers. We requested assitance to the airport personnel, but they did not help at all and told us that I we did not want to loose the connection flight, we had to do custom clearance, get our luggage and do the check in again at the Qatar desk. The personnel of the airport was disrespectful and with a total lack of customer service attitude. We had little time to decide and we finally made to the check in counter of qatar at the airport. When we did the check in, we were charged 200.000 rp which I think is completely wrong. 1) The airport tax was included in my ticket as the regulation changed on February 2015, Denpasar Airport tax was included , as I booked my flight during Sept 2015. 2) We were passenger in transit that did not get any help from Qatar or airport personnel and we wanted to take our flight.

We noticed this after a request to show our tickets half-way enroute to London.

8,6,1,1,1489,"Hi Just booked a flight with Ryanair and cannot find an option to add Advanced Passenger Information anywhere, even in Manage my Booking. I usually travel with Easyjet so am used to filling in the information on their website. Where can I fill it in if travelling with Ryanair? I have heard that you now add all the details when checking in online instead of having a separate page to fill in whenever you like. However, I thought that API was required at least 48 hours before the flight time, yet Ryanair allow you to check in up to 4 hours before the flight leaves, so how does this work? Is there a well-hidden API option somewhere that I have missed?

I don't see the relevance, other than to contrive a way to not meet their advertised promises, However, it gets worse. CoA sent me a hotel coupon to use in conjunction with my (disputed) flight.

Once in Minneapolis we were told by Delta that we did not have reservations to fly to Fargo , even though the ticket we received did show a flight , we were then told to see a United ticket agent , and that was in a different terminal . Well off i went , unfortunately the first agent i found was on the phone , he proceeded to tell me , by putting his hand on receiver that he will be on the phone for awhile , i then grabbed my TICKETS and proceeded to the next gate , still not knowing whether we had a flight . The next terminal had an agent dealing with a client , 2 other people were standing just behind the gate having an animated conversation , after 10 mins 1 left and went back to original United gate ..The agent was off the phone , looked at my tickets , reprinted them and said YOU DO have reservations for that flight , go see delta . Off i went to delta again , different terminal again , I was again told by Delta we did not have reservations and I need to go back to United !!!!!!!!!!! At this point I was probably I step away from loosing it , the agent then offered me the United PHONE NUMBER !! ..... After some enormous restraint I insisted she call !!

8,6,1,1,1581,"I recently returned from 3 weeks in Europe after flying with BA a few times and just wanted to share my experiences I had with the airline. ---- from YVR to LHR: Departed on time, arrived at LHR 20 minutes early. I paid about $100 extra for an exit row seat (28J) and couldn't recommend this more. The seat is located in the first row in Economy, right behind Club World. After takeoff, they close the curtain and due to there being no toilets here, there's no one walking around to disturb you. My seat was right beside the door which kind of protrudes out. This was used as my leg rest for the entire duration of the flight. If you can't afford Premium Economy, this is a really great option. Dinner was a choice of pasta (with feta and tomatoes) or chicken (with rice and veggies). I had the pasta which was actually quite tasty - by no means a five star meal, but not bad for plane food. The chocolate dessert was delicious. After dinner service, lights went out and it was time to sleep. A word of warning - it's extremely cold by the exits. I had a blanket and jacket but I was still shivering throughout the entire flight. In hindsight, I'm not sure why I didn't ask for an extra blanket - I must have been delirious with sleep... Breakfast is served about an hour before landing. It consisted of a fruit muffin, yogurt, and a box of raisins (?!). Not very filling, but oh well. IFE was average - I only watched one movie before going to sleep. The new releases were nothing to get excited about, so it may be wise to bring your own entertainment. BA85 from LHR to YVR: My experience on this flight was similar to the above, except this time I had seat 29K. This is also an exit row seat but in the second row of economy with a missing seat in front which allows you to enter the aisle by walking in front (and not over your seat mates). It was a good seat but not as good as any of the exit row seats in row 28 which just feel more spacious. This flight departed a bit late and arrived 45 minutes late at YVR. I also flew from LHR to BCN (BA486), and AMS to LHR (BA435) on their smaller planes. Both plane interiors looked brand spanking new. I managed to score exit row seats on both these fights as well which was a nice bonus even though the flights were quite short in duration. There's no IFE but they do serve a small snack and free drinks on both flights. I don't know what the snacks were as I declined them on both flights. Overall, a very good experience with BA.

The Australian newspaper says the Monday incident ""is set to prompt a worldwide alert to Boeing 747 operators after the problem was traced to a cracked drip tray under the first-class galley."" In a story from this morning, the Morning Herald says ""water from the blocked drain collected in a drip tray under the floor. A crack in the drip tray caused the water to leak into electrical wiring. Each of the plane's four engines has its own generator, but the water shorted out the aircraft's power supply."" David Cox, Qantas' executive general manager responsible for engineering, tells The Australian ""it was just like tipping a glass of water into your stereo."" Dr. Arvind Sinha, director of aerospace at RMIT University in Melbourne, explains to the Morning Herald that ""the engines have their own independent power source and the steering is operated by a hydraulic pump system, but the critical issues are the navigation and communication systems that you need to find your way to a runway to land."" Colin Adams of the Australian and International Pilot's Association says the Qantas crew and passengers were ""lucky"" that the plane was not far out over open water when the incident occurred, according to the London Daily Mail. ""In that situation you have a minimum of 30 minutes before you lose power to the flight instruments,"" Adams tells the Morning Herald. ""After that the only idea that you have of airspeed and where you are in relation to what's around you is what you can see out of the window. There is no written procedure for what happens in that situation -- it's the pilot and his wits. If you were a long way from an airfield at night it would be an extremely hazardous situation.

Never had a flight cancelled before due to weather but it would have to be today of all days.At least EZY managed to let me know by text and e-mail BEFORE I left for Schiphol.

8,6,1,1,1716,"I know Jetstar regularly get a slating for their delays and bad service, so thought it was only fair I shared the excellent experience we had with them recently. We flew Christchurch NZL to Narita Airport, Tokyo via the Gold Coast Airport. The flights were on time going over, no issues with delays or connections. The flight was delayed an hour coming back, but apart from that we had no issues with onwards connections, lost bags etc. The planes were lovely and service great. The thing that impressed us most was regarding our request to have luggage on the way back. We had booked a while back when they had a 2:1 special (2 fly for price of 1). We booked our basic flights ex Chch. Over the next few weeks we got several emails changing details of our flight. For the most part these were tiny changes: change of terminal, flights changing times by 5-10 minutes (in our favour), however, one of the changes was canning the return flight to Chch and putting us on a flight to Auckland, then a domestic flight to Chch. We didn't have any choice but to accept this as our trip was on quite a tight timeframe. Later we decided that we wanted to have one person with 10kg baggage on the way back to allow for a few souvenirs we planned to get. When we went to do this online, we found that it would cost us $98 (which we were prepared to pay) plus $15 more because of the domestic flight we now had through the change to their scheduling. We decided to wait until the airport and ask them there to waive the $15 as it was not our choice to do that leg. The lady at the airport counter spent quite a bit of time going through our booking history, then she handed us our boarding passes and said no problem. I pulled out my cc to pay for the Narita-AKL baggage and she said there was no charge for that either. We had asked for one person to have 10kg and she loaded 15kg baggage on both our tickets for free. We thought that was pretty good and were happy with that! When we got onto the Gold Coast-Auckland leg of our return flight we discovered we had exit row seats and then when the food trolley came round, the hostess informed us we each had $10 voucher for food. This was our first time flying long haul with a LCC.

We could not book in online, it came up as check in at airport. We arrived at Heathrow at 02:30 for a 6am flight. The passport machine would not let us check in. We were directed to different desks around the airport, the final one being the Special Assistance desk. There was already a family with a problem at the desk and there was no senior members of staff to help us. We were told there was a problem with our Esta.

We were told to go to the ticket desk and buy new tickets! There was no staff from TAP airlines to help us. The manager eventually came back from the gate and agreed to talk to us. After much discussion we were booked on United flights the following day. Our party of 9 were split up into 5 and 4. 4 going first via Newark, then 5 going 5 hours later via Houston. They would not discuss how we wanted the party split resulting in my daughter's friend flying with our other family members. We were due to arrive in Miami on Sat afternoon but got there Monday morning. We were at Heathrow for 32 hours with children. Tap would not help us with a hotel, meals, nothing!

8,6,1,1,1780,"My partner and I recently flew back from Barcelona to Heathrow with BA. The flight was delayed by 2.5 hours, resulting in our getting into Heathrow after midnight, when all public transport other than taxis had ceased running. During the flight, we were told on two occasions by crew that if passengers were to take a taxi home, this would be refunded in full by the airline on presentation of a receipt. On arrival, we received a quote from a London black cab for £85-90 to North London. This would normally be an excessive expense for us, but as it was 12.30am we took the taxi in order to get home quickly (and in the understanding that reimbursement would be forthcoming). The final fare ended up being £97. However, on making a claim and presenting our taxi receipt, we were informed by BA's Customer Relations department that we would only be refunded £50 as the full amount was considered 'beyond reasonable' and it would be 'unfair to other customers' to make an exception. After querying this further - and stressing that passengers were explicitly told that they would be 'fully' refunded for any taxi journeys - we finally learnt (via a response from the airline's Twitter account!) that the maximum compensation given for transport is £50. I wondered if any others have experienced something similar? I think it's fair to say that we and the other passengers were misled by BA, who promised something only to fail to deliver, leaving us considerably out of pocket. They also appear to be completely oblivious to the actual cost of a standard taxi from Heathrow to London! If anybody has any suggestions on alternative channels for proceeding with this, it would be much appreciated. I have already considered raising it with the CAA. ----","[My partner and I recently flew back from Barcelona to Heathrow with BA. ]The flight was delayed by 2.5 hours, resulting in our getting into Heathrow after midnight, when all public transport other than taxis had ceased running.

The officials at Crete weighed my hand luggage and found it to be overweight. I had NEVER had hand luggage weighed before, even on the Thomson flight out. I was sent to a different desk in order to check in my hand luggage as a second bag for the hold. I was told this would be €25 and begrudgingly agreed to this, pointing out that this had NOT been a problem on the way over for the SAME bag. Upon reaching the desk, I was told that ON TOP of the €25 I had to pay an amount per every kilo this bag weighed. I was presented with a total fee for checking in a very small hand-luggage sized bag, of....wait for it....€133! The staff were rude, dismissive and told me this was Thompson policy and the airline was rigorous in its baggage checks. This obviously only applies on your return flight, where you have no other option of leaving stuff, and struggle to understand the language and make yourself understood. I felt bullied and was reduced to tears. During discussion, I was told my flight was completely full - it was not. I was also told if I didn't pay up, the €133 would be taken from the pocket of the lady working on the Thomson desk! (really?!) There were other people queuing, all bitterly upset with the surcharges dumped on them for the return flight only. I eventually rectified the situation by donating my beach towels and books to Thomson, and wearing approx 4kg of my clothes, thus saving myself €133.

While Qantas has not had an accident/incident where people died, tarnished is the operative word for them. They are gradually whittling away any benefits at all. Recently I booked with their subsidiary, Jetstar, Sydney - Honolulu return with business options. Here, the add-ons they normally charge to go cattle are generally included. I have a cattle class Sydney-Brisbane return with them as well and that has add-on costs galore. My real beef is the dreadful Jetstar website and lack of connection with that of Daddy QANTAS. In spite of endless patience and a very fast Internet connection, the Jetstar site is woefully slow and has severe Alzheimer's! The site continues to insist that I have no booking for my international leg although I have a confirmed itinerary and a booking number: absolutely a denial that such a booking exists. A call to their customer service department took two days to get through! It kept ringing out or I got a number unreachable message. When I did connect, I was assured there was such a booking but not according to my profile. However, the domestic booking is there! Go figure! With well over 400,000 frequent flyer points, Qantas has a couple of reward options for flight redemptions but of course, taxes can be extreme so one might just as well buy a ticket anyway. To sum up, Qantas is a dead duck and I avoid them generally. My loyalty is focused elsewhere!",1675,1599,0.0453731343,0

8,6,1,1,1916,"I just called to clear the outstanding balance of 6 day trip to NY which cost my friend and I £400 EACH - bargain (or so we thought). When I called a few wks ago to pay of £590 I was informed that the airfare taxes had risen by £20pp. At the time of booking the agent who booked the holiday said it was possible that they would rise once before the o/b was paid off but not by much. I was a bit annoyed that I hadn't been called/emailed and informed of this, and that it was casually mentioned at the time of payment but I accepted it s I was told they need my ""ok"" before they could deduct the £590 off my card. I asked at least 3 times if the taxes would rise again and was told no repeatedly. All was fine and with the new £20pp tax fee ...my outstanding balance now stood at £64.90 and my friend's was £54.90. I called today (the last day to pay off the booking) to pay the final £119.80 and am told ""Oh it's £150 you owe madam and if it's not paid today you will lose the holiday"". I've had the worst week imaginable and completely lost my cool as I found it incredibly cheeky that they appeared to have plucked this sum out of the air as I had had my o/b confirmed to me repeatedly during the last phone call 3 weeks ago!! I disputed the o/b and went through the maths with the woman on the phone who couldn't understand what I was saying and was in a bloody call centre in India and who said that she'd escalate my complaint to a manager who'd call tomorrow...cue more ranting from me that today was the last day to pay the o/b and that a phone call tomorrow would be useless if she was saying that I'd lose the holiday if it wasn't paid off today. I asked to be transferred through to the sales team as she was in the customer services team and seemingly in a differennt country! After being put on hold for a while an English sounding guy came on the line, asking what the problem was..at this point I'm in tears as I'm so stressed out and he tells me ""You won't lose the holiday as you're talking to me now. You called us, it's fine. Your tickets have been dispatched anyway"". He says that the price of the holiday may have gone up and didn't I get any emails from the woman who booked it for me bk in October. I haven't heard from here since the day I bloody booked it!!!!!! I tell him how I was told that the taxes would not be rising again and how I'd budgeted down to the last penny for what I believed I owed. He gave me this agents direct line telling me she'd be in tomorrow 9:00-5:30pm and that she knew more about the booking and would be able to help me. I'm so angry at this shoddy service from Travelocity. You can't go adding money onto peoples outstanding balances without informing them beforehand!!! I lost my job recently so money is tight at the moment and to say I'm still shaking with anger is not an exaggeration! I was in bloody tears to the guy on the phone.

8,6,1,1,1979,"Dear Readers I recently (June and July2010) travelled to Europe from Australia with my wife and 3 children aged 16,11 and 9. We visited France, Greece and England. I booked and paid for 3 flights with Easy Jet prior to our departure. The first two flights were uneventful. However our last flight from Athens to London ended up blowing my holiday budget out of the water. We were booked on an Olympic Air flight out of Paros in the Greek Islands a flight that is 20 minutes in length and was scheduled to depart at 16.05pm. Our Easy Jet Connection was due to depart at 19.00 and check in closed at 18.20. Due to the late incoming plane to Paros we did not arrive in at Athens airport until 17.55pm and we were promptly transferred to the terminal by an awaiting bus and were in the terminal at 18.00. I advised my wife and children to go and retrieve the bags and I raced up to the Easy Jet counter to commence check in. By the time I got to the counter it was 18.18pm on my watch and on the clocks in the terminal but there were no Easy Jet staff at the check in at all. The next day there was an Air Traffic Controllers strike that had been scheduled and we had non-refundable accommodation and other paid activities in London. I went looking for the Easy Jet representative in the Terminal who advised that as it was at that stage, 18.21pm by her watch the flight had closed, there were no staff available and there was nothing she could do other than advise us that due to industrial action and bookings we would not be likely to get paid seats with Easy Jet for 3 days. Faced with this I looked for flights departing to London that night and found a British Airways flight due to depart at 19.10. I was advised by a BA representative that she may be able to get 5 seats but would not know until 18.40. She managed to get 5 economy seats for which I was charged in excess of EURO2500 or Australian $3557.00. I spoke to BA the next day in London and a staff member told me that I was charged adult fares for the two children under 12 and that I should be entitled to a 25% refund. The battle to do this is still going on with the BA refunds section and the initial response that I received when the matter was referred to BA customer relations was that BA only have 2 classes of economy seats adult and infant ie 2 and under. There website would suggest otherwise. I have written to Easy Jet and am awaiting a response and will detail it in this forum when it is to hand. I think the moral of this story is that allow the widest possible berth between connection if travelling on a discount carrier. Do not accept the check in closure time will be adhered to by staff of a budget carrier and make sure that you have travel insurance that covers the scenario of a missed connection, as many policies in this regard will only give you a limited amount in very limited circumstances. I will keep you all posted. ------- Sydney","[Dear Readers I recently (June and July2010) travelled to Europe from Australia with my wife and 3 children aged 16,11 and 9.

Until last week I hadn't flown from CWL since the incident in the previous thread, but last Monday once again my contact lens solution was selected at for testing ... Once again, the staff were polite and professional - but this time I was prepared! My regular ""explosive"" solution was in my checked luggage, and in my hand luggage I was just carrying a 100ml bottle of solution that Specsavers said shouldn't test positive - and they were right. It passed the swab test and I was allowed to take it with me. In all the years I've been travelling I have never had contact lens solution tested at any other airport (apart from once in Bilbao, when they suspected it was something totally different - but that's another story ...), but maybe this will help anyone travelling through Cardiff with contact lens solution in their hand luggage - they seem to be on the lookout for it (I was assured I was simply chosen at random, though I'm sure I spotted a look of glee in the security staff eyes when they saw the bottle going through the X-ray machine ...). For clarification, the solution that tested positive was Specsavers' Easyvision Allpurpose solution; the ""safe"" solution is the Easyvision Multipurpose.

8,6,1,1,2134,We flew to Phoenix from Toronto last week. This was bar none the worst flight I have ever taken. It was tighter than any Air Transat that I've flown. The seats are so close together that even I was uncomfortable at 5 feet tall. My husband is over 6 feet and he was miserable. I fortunately was in the aisle seat but the couple occupying the middle and window had a 2 year old on their lap. I felt very sorry for them. The wife couldn't even get her purse out from under the seat until we all stood up. I took out my tape measure and measured the distance from the front edge of my seat to the seat in front. It was 7 inches!! Up until now I have opted for Air Canada when travelling south but no more! There is also no TV on Rouge so you better have an IPad or be prepared to pay $10 to rent one.,[We flew to Phoenix from Toronto last week. This was bar none the worst flight I have ever taken.

8,6,1,1,2270,"I appreciate that there are still alot of stranded people out there and I hope you all get home soon. but here was our story. I thought it best to wait 'till we all got home so we can give hopefully a balanced perspective of events. We were due to fly home on 15th April, when it all first happened from Atlanta. We were about 250 miles from the airport, just waking up in our hotel room when we heard the news on CNN, and obviously devastated. It was more the ""not knowing"" than anything else. The website (BA) told us not to go to the airport, and it was about 2.5 hours to speak to someone on the phone. We had to go and return the rental car anyway at ATL so had some hours to calm down and think a bit, rather than turn up to check in totally unaware and panic. The news in the U.S on this was fairly low key at the time from what we saw, and we got more information by logging on to UK news websites, it really felt like doom and gloom from what the media were saying. On our arrival at check in, we handed in my pre printed boarding passes to the BA check in staff, and decided just to book ourselves on the next available flight out, which was 6 days later. Again feeling devastated by the wait and potential additional expense that wasn't budgeted for (or so we thought). The kids were upset, the wife too, however ""keep calm"" I said to myself, trying to hold it all together ,as there is nothing you can do. BA check in staff were truely exceptional, along with ATL dispatchers for the flight (BA226 ATL-LHR on 15th Apr '10). Although they could not doing anything about the flight, their service went beyond the call of duty in terms of help, advice, and being put up in a hotel nearby with all meals paid for. BA, the hotel staff, ATL staff, and the British Consulate in downtown all worked together for the benefit of the passengers. All of them worked 110% to help us, and it will never be forgotten. I was aware of the other horror stories from other airlines just ""dumping"" their passengers with little more than $7 per day to survive on. We remember a group of 4/5 parent helpers looking after 20 or so kids who were representing the UK in a robotic tournament in Atlanta flying on an American airline who had to start paying out of their own pockets. I hope you got back safely if you're reading this. We also rememberd at the consulate, another passenger ""dumped"" by another European airline, with no one to talk to, speak to, or given any advice until the Consulate stepped in. There are hundreds more I know, and we are lucky to be what I think are the fortunate few who flew on BA. I'm not one to hype up BA, as I had some reservations on flying with them, but after this experience, and if I ever decide to fly again then there will only be 1 airline to choose from. I hope everyone can receive some form of recompense. Up to then my faith in British society had been strained to say the least, but this experience is something I'll never forget, that yes there are people out there who care and want to make a difference.

8,6,1,1,2366,"Yesterday I flew home from Jeddah via Doha on Qater Airways. On boarding the flight from Doha to Manchester it was quite chaotic in the forward economy cabin of the Airbus A330. Numerous families had unilaterally decided to seat themselves together regardless of their seat assignments. The poor FA spent 15 mins trying to get people into their correct seats. I reserved my usual aisle seat, but I had now been moved into a central aisle seat rather than my usual window aisle seat. I would hazard a guess this occurred to try and keep a family on the same row if possible, no big deal to be honest. However in my row was a mother and 2 children. The father of the family demanded rather than ask that I change seats with him, now if he'd been seated in business then fair enough, even accounting for his rather rude attitude. However he was seated in a centre seat behind me, I told him sorry but I dislike to being trapped in. He then became extremely rude, at which point I reported him to the FA. The FA had a word with him and he went off in Huff to his seat. Several hours later his young son looked at me and said "" your the nasty bl@@dy man who wouldn't move"" I guess that comment says it all really, clearly such language shouldn't come from a 3 yr old child. I have moved before to try and assist a family, as long as it's a similar seat close by then that's fine. This rather rude incident will definitely give me pause for thought in future.

8,6,1,1,2492,"I have recently switched to Clear Care, a hydrogen peroxide based contact lens solution, due to my eye care professional's recommendation. In a few months, this will be my first time traveling with it (by air). I have been hearing stories of TSA officers confiscating such solution in carry on baggage and not being able to negotiate citing medical necessity as a reason, even when the bottle is in compliance with the 3-1-1 limitation. The reasoning is that hydrogen peroxide can potentially be used as an explosive. I am wondering what people's experiences are with this? I have always known that it is best to have enough of your contact lens care material in your carry on baggage in case your checked baggage gets delayed. However, I now use exclusively Clear Care, and if that does not make it through TSA, I will be left with nothing upon arrival if my checked baggage gets delayed. I am planning to travel to an Asian destination, where there is almost no guarantee that I will be able to find the product for sale.

I have never been on a more unpleasant flight. ]I was in economy class. A 7+ hour flight with a family of 4 behind me. The kids were an infant maybe 4 months old and a 2 year old. The kids alternated crying, screaming, howling and seat kicking the entire flight. Parents did nothing to stop this.[ Directly beside across the aisle were 2 parents with Junior lap baby that looked way to big to be a lap baby. Just before the lunch service Dad decided he was going to change Junior's very soiled diaper right there in the seat. From my vantage point, I could both see and smell everything that was going on. Absolutely vile. Needless to say, I was shocked. Just before landing, round # 2. The parents just rolled up the used diapers and placed them under the seats! The aircraft bathrooms had diaper changing tables too! A lack of class by these parents.] Wondering if anyone else has witnessed such rude behavior lately while flying? Would you have complained to the Crew?",1082,582,0.4621072089,1

I don't see the relevance, other than to contrive a way to not meet their advertised promises, However, it gets worse. CoA sent me a hotel coupon to use in conjunction with my (disputed) flight. I decided to use it to shave my loss. Found the hotel I wanted on the dates I needed. I provided all the information including full credit card data. Agreed to CoA terms, hit Confirm, and received a confirmation of - ANOTHER FLIGHT! Nothing about a hotel., No email confirm. Nothing. Now, forced to endure the one hour phone wait, I spoke to a representative who claimed that AmEx had rejected the charge. I called Amex and they denied that. Lie # 1. The CoA rep (still on the phone) told me she would book it directly, but after several minutes, told me the hotel had sold out, and would I like to book somewhere else? That is Lie # 2, because I promptly went to (very reliable) Hotels.com and successfully booked exactly what CoA had originally offered at the same (pre-coupon) price. I also confirmed the booking with the hotel itself. I've booked many air and hotel tickets with CoA, and never had a problem. However, I also never tried to do anything even slightly out of the ordinary, like use a coupon or rely on a guarantee, This is a trust business. Buh-Bye, CheapoAir,",1876,21,0.9888059701,0

8,2,1,1,1565,"Since Usairways merger with American our service and prices have suffered out of Charlotte. My last experience made me vow to never fly them unless I absolutely had to. My wife and I just returned from a round trip via Delta from Charlotte to Jacksonville, FL. We flew first class cheaper than a coach seat on AA. From the moment we stepped up to the ticket counter in Charlotte until we got our baggage back at the end of the trip, it was amazing to experience the difference in service. The comparison between first class on Delta and first class on AA is amazing. Delta on each leg had chilled water bottles waiting at our seat, fresh blankets, pillows, and the flight attendants came down the aisle and took drink orders on the ground, and seamlessly replaced empty water bottles. Snacks were first rate and included fresh fruit and unique offerings. The entire crew was dressed very sharply, smiled, and actually thanked us for flying with them. They seemed to genuinely enjoy their jobs. Every flight on AA that we've taken since the merger we could hear the flight attendants complaining and they could care less about the service. Not once did passengers get berated by the flight attendants to hurry up so they could have an on time departure by the Delta crews....it is common place on AA. It was as if we stepped back in time when air travel was enjoyable. On each leg of the trip, our luggage was waiting on us when we arrived at baggage claim. AA is lucky to get it to you within 30 minutes. Best decision we've made to switch our business to Delta.","Since Usairways merger with American our service and prices have suffered out of Charlotte.

I paid about $100 extra for an exit row seat (28J) and couldn't recommend this more. The seat is located in the first row in Economy, right behind Club World. After takeoff, they close the curtain and due to there being no toilets here, there's no one walking around to disturb you. My seat was right beside the door which kind of protrudes out. This was used as my leg rest for the entire duration of the flight. If you can't afford Premium Economy, this is a really great option. Dinner was a choice of pasta (with feta and tomatoes) or chicken (with rice and veggies). I had the pasta which was actually quite tasty - by no means a five star meal, but not bad for plane food. The chocolate dessert was delicious. After dinner service, lights went out and it was time to sleep. A word of warning - it's extremely cold by the exits. I had a blanket and jacket but I was still shivering throughout the entire flight. In hindsight, I'm not sure why I didn't ask for an extra blanket - I must have been delirious with sleep... Breakfast is served about an hour before landing. It consisted of a fruit muffin, yogurt, and a box of raisins (?!). Not very filling, but oh well. IFE was average - I only watched one movie before going to sleep. The new releases were nothing to get excited about, so it may be wise to bring your own entertainment. BA85 from LHR to YVR: My experience on this flight was similar to the above, except this time I had seat 29K. This is also an exit row seat but in the second row of economy with a missing seat in front which allows you to enter the aisle by walking in front (and not over your seat mates). It was a good seat but not as good as any of the exit row seats in row 28 which just feel more spacious. This flight departed a bit late and arrived 45 minutes late at YVR. I also flew from LHR to BCN (BA486), and AMS to LHR (BA435) on their smaller planes. Both plane interiors looked brand spanking new. I managed to score exit row seats on both these fights as well which was a nice bonus even though the flights were quite short in duration.

Dr. Arvind Sinha, director of aerospace at RMIT University in Melbourne, explains to the Morning Herald that ""the engines have their own independent power source and the steering is operated by a hydraulic pump system, but the critical issues are the navigation and communication systems that you need to find your way to a runway to land.""

8,2,1,1,1716,"I know Jetstar regularly get a slating for their delays and bad service, so thought it was only fair I shared the excellent experience we had with them recently. We flew Christchurch NZL to Narita Airport, Tokyo via the Gold Coast Airport. The flights were on time going over, no issues with delays or connections. The flight was delayed an hour coming back, but apart from that we had no issues with onwards connections, lost bags etc. The planes were lovely and service great. The thing that impressed us most was regarding our request to have luggage on the way back. We had booked a while back when they had a 2:1 special (2 fly for price of 1). We booked our basic flights ex Chch. Over the next few weeks we got several emails changing details of our flight. For the most part these were tiny changes: change of terminal, flights changing times by 5-10 minutes (in our favour), however, one of the changes was canning the return flight to Chch and putting us on a flight to Auckland, then a domestic flight to Chch. We didn't have any choice but to accept this as our trip was on quite a tight timeframe. Later we decided that we wanted to have one person with 10kg baggage on the way back to allow for a few souvenirs we planned to get. When we went to do this online, we found that it would cost us $98 (which we were prepared to pay) plus $15 more because of the domestic flight we now had through the change to their scheduling. We decided to wait until the airport and ask them there to waive the $15 as it was not our choice to do that leg. The lady at the airport counter spent quite a bit of time going through our booking history, then she handed us our boarding passes and said no problem. I pulled out my cc to pay for the Narita-AKL baggage and she said there was no charge for that either. We had asked for one person to have 10kg and she loaded 15kg baggage on both our tickets for free. We thought that was pretty good and were happy with that! When we got onto the Gold Coast-Auckland leg of our return flight we discovered we had exit row seats and then when the food trolley came round, the hostess informed us we each had $10 voucher for food. This was our first time flying long haul with a LCC. Even without the freebies we got as compensation for the change of return flight, we found it a good experience and would happily fly Jetstar long haul again out of NZ/Australia.","I know Jetstar regularly get a slating for their delays and bad service, so thought it was only fair I shared the excellent experience we had with them recently. We flew Christchurch NZL to Narita Airport, Tokyo via the Gold Coast Airport. The flights were on time going over, no issues with delays or connections. The flight was delayed an hour coming back, but apart from that we had no issues with onwards connections, lost bags etc. The planes were lovely and service great. The thing that impressed us most was regarding our request to have luggage on the way back. We had booked a while back when they had a 2:1 special (2 fly for price of 1). We booked our basic flights ex Chch. Over the next few weeks we got several emails changing details of our flight. For the most part these were tiny changes: change of terminal, flights changing times by 5-10 minutes (in our favour), however, one of the changes was canning the return flight to Chch and putting us on a flight to Auckland, then a domestic flight to Chch. We didn't have any choice but to accept this as our trip was on quite a tight timeframe.

Has anyone ever gotten one of these approved? Now that I'm researching it, I've yet to come across anyone who has been approved. I'll definitely be looking at other options next time I fly, not because of the lack of a price match, but because of the awful customer service I have received.

8,2,1,1,1780,"My partner and I recently flew back from Barcelona to Heathrow with BA. The flight was delayed by 2.5 hours, resulting in our getting into Heathrow after midnight, when all public transport other than taxis had ceased running. During the flight, we were told on two occasions by crew that if passengers were to take a taxi home, this would be refunded in full by the airline on presentation of a receipt. On arrival, we received a quote from a London black cab for £85-90 to North London. This would normally be an excessive expense for us, but as it was 12.30am we took the taxi in order to get home quickly (and in the understanding that reimbursement would be forthcoming). The final fare ended up being £97. However, on making a claim and presenting our taxi receipt, we were informed by BA's Customer Relations department that we would only be refunded £50 as the full amount was considered 'beyond reasonable' and it would be 'unfair to other customers' to make an exception. After querying this further - and stressing that passengers were explicitly told that they would be 'fully' refunded for any taxi journeys - we finally learnt (via a response from the airline's Twitter account!) that the maximum compensation given for transport is £50. I wondered if any others have experienced something similar? I think it's fair to say that we and the other passengers were misled by BA, who promised something only to fail to deliver, leaving us considerably out of pocket. They also appear to be completely oblivious to the actual cost of a standard taxi from Heathrow to London! If anybody has any suggestions on alternative channels for proceeding with this, it would be much appreciated. I have already considered raising it with the CAA. ----","[My partner and I recently flew back from Barcelona to Heathrow with BA. ]The flight was delayed by 2.5 hours, resulting in our getting into Heathrow after midnight, when all public transport other than taxis had ceased running.

8,2,1,1,1916,"I just called to clear the outstanding balance of 6 day trip to NY which cost my friend and I £400 EACH - bargain (or so we thought). When I called a few wks ago to pay of £590 I was informed that the airfare taxes had risen by £20pp. At the time of booking the agent who booked the holiday said it was possible that they would rise once before the o/b was paid off but not by much. I was a bit annoyed that I hadn't been called/emailed and informed of this, and that it was casually mentioned at the time of payment but I accepted it s I was told they need my ""ok"" before they could deduct the £590 off my card. I asked at least 3 times if the taxes would rise again and was told no repeatedly. All was fine and with the new £20pp tax fee ...my outstanding balance now stood at £64.90 and my friend's was £54.90. I called today (the last day to pay off the booking) to pay the final £119.80 and am told ""Oh it's £150 you owe madam and if it's not paid today you will lose the holiday"". I've had the worst week imaginable and completely lost my cool as I found it incredibly cheeky that they appeared to have plucked this sum out of the air as I had had my o/b confirmed to me repeatedly during the last phone call 3 weeks ago!! I disputed the o/b and went through the maths with the woman on the phone who couldn't understand what I was saying and was in a bloody call centre in India and who said that she'd escalate my complaint to a manager who'd call tomorrow...cue more ranting from me that today was the last day to pay the o/b and that a phone call tomorrow would be useless if she was saying that I'd lose the holiday if it wasn't paid off today. I asked to be transferred through to the sales team as she was in the customer services team and seemingly in a differennt country! After being put on hold for a while an English sounding guy came on the line, asking what the problem was..at this point I'm in tears as I'm so stressed out and he tells me ""You won't lose the holiday as you're talking to me now. You called us, it's fine. Your tickets have been dispatched anyway"".

I'm so stressed out at the moment. They can't do this again can they??? They'd have the call on tape where I was told in no terms would the taxes be rising again.. I wasn't even told by the lady in India where the additional £30 had come from!!!!!!!! Will be ringing the lady who booked the trip for me first thing tomorrow morning but would appreciate any advice if possible. Many thanks for reading my rant ....*and breathe*","I just called to clear the outstanding balance of 6 day trip to NY which cost my friend and I £400 EACH - bargain (or so we thought). When I called a few wks ago to pay of £590 I was informed that the airfare taxes had risen by £20pp. At the time of booking the agent who booked the holiday said it was possible that they would rise once before the o/b was paid off but not by much. I was a bit annoyed that I hadn't been called/emailed and informed of this, and that it was casually mentioned at the time of payment but I accepted it s I was told they need my ""ok"" before they could deduct the £590 off my card. I asked at least 3 times if the taxes would rise again and was told no repeatedly. All was fine and with the new £20pp tax fee ...my outstanding balance now stood at £64.90 and my friend's was £54.90. I called today (the last day to pay off the booking) to pay the final £119.80 and am told ""Oh it's £150 you owe madam and if it's not paid today you will lose the holiday"". I've had the worst week imaginable and completely lost my cool as I found it incredibly cheeky that they appeared to have plucked this sum out of the air as I had had my o/b confirmed to me repeatedly during the last phone call 3 weeks ago!! I disputed the o/b and went through the maths with the woman on the phone who couldn't understand what I was saying and was in a bloody call centre in India and who said that she'd escalate my complaint to a manager who'd call tomorrow...cue more ranting from me that today was the last day to pay the o/b and that a phone call tomorrow would be useless if she was saying that I'd lose the holiday if it wasn't paid off today. I asked to be transferred through to the sales team as she was in the customer services team and seemingly in a differennt country!

That wasn't a big drama, but a bit annoying when you book through an agent for some service. The real problem started at the airport, we tried to check in but the airline had no record of our booking even though Orbitz had issued us paper tickets showing apparent valid ticket numbers. I tried to call Orbitz at the airport but by the time I finally got to speak to someone and have them understand that a) I was at the airport trying to check in b) No, i didn't want to cancel my booking and c) I am Australian, so my zip code has only 4 digits, we were forced to purchase new tickets at the airport to be able to board at a cost of around $250 before check-in close. Since the flight, I have tried to contact Alitalia about the issue, with no response whatsoever and Orbitz by email, who just say to call. When I call, I'm repeatedly put on hold (paying international call rates) and was told on the last call that ""Orbitz will not refund the tickets as the airline re-accommodated us on a later flight.""

8,2,1,1,1979,"Dear Readers I recently (June and July2010) travelled to Europe from Australia with my wife and 3 children aged 16,11 and 9. We visited France, Greece and England. I booked and paid for 3 flights with Easy Jet prior to our departure. The first two flights were uneventful. However our last flight from Athens to London ended up blowing my holiday budget out of the water. We were booked on an Olympic Air flight out of Paros in the Greek Islands a flight that is 20 minutes in length and was scheduled to depart at 16.05pm. Our Easy Jet Connection was due to depart at 19.00 and check in closed at 18.20. Due to the late incoming plane to Paros we did not arrive in at Athens airport until 17.55pm and we were promptly transferred to the terminal by an awaiting bus and were in the terminal at 18.00. I advised my wife and children to go and retrieve the bags and I raced up to the Easy Jet counter to commence check in. By the time I got to the counter it was 18.18pm on my watch and on the clocks in the terminal but there were no Easy Jet staff at the check in at all. The next day there was an Air Traffic Controllers strike that had been scheduled and we had non-refundable accommodation and other paid activities in London. I went looking for the Easy Jet representative in the Terminal who advised that as it was at that stage, 18.21pm by her watch the flight had closed, there were no staff available and there was nothing she could do other than advise us that due to industrial action and bookings we would not be likely to get paid seats with Easy Jet for 3 days. Faced with this I looked for flights departing to London that night and found a British Airways flight due to depart at 19.10. I was advised by a BA representative that she may be able to get 5 seats but would not know until 18.40. She managed to get 5 economy seats for which I was charged in excess of EURO2500 or Australian $3557.00.

I will keep you all posted. ------- Sydney","[Dear Readers I recently (June and July2010) travelled to Europe from Australia with my wife and 3 children aged 16,11 and 9. We visited France, Greece and England. I booked and paid for 3 flights with Easy Jet prior to our departure. The first two flights were uneventful. However our last flight from Athens to London ended up blowing my holiday budget out of the water. We were booked on an Olympic Air flight out of Paros in the Greek Islands a flight that is 20 minutes in length and was scheduled to depart at 16.05pm. Our Easy Jet Connection was due to depart at 19.00 and check in closed at 18.20. Due to the late incoming plane to Paros we did not arrive in at Athens airport until 17.55pm and we were promptly transferred to the terminal by an awaiting bus and were in the terminal at 18.00. I advised my wife and children to go and retrieve the bags and I raced up to the Easy Jet counter to commence check in. By the time I got to the counter it was 18.18pm on my watch and on the clocks in the terminal but there were no Easy Jet staff at the check in at all. The next day there was an Air Traffic Controllers strike that had been scheduled and we had non-refundable accommodation and other paid activities in London. I went looking for the Easy Jet representative in the Terminal who advised that as it was at that stage, 18.21pm by her watch the flight had closed, there were no staff available and there was nothing she could do other than advise us that due to industrial action and bookings we would not be likely to get paid seats with Easy Jet for 3 days. Faced with this I looked for flights departing to London that night and found a British Airways flight due to depart at 19.10. I was advised by a BA representative that she may be able to get 5 seats but would not know until 18.40. She managed to get 5 economy seats for which I was charged in excess of EURO2500 or Australian $3557.00.

8,2,1,1,2056,"Hi everyone, A quick question - we have booked through BA to travel to Bali, via Changi. We're flying British Airways from LHR to Singapore, but our connecting flight is on Jetstar, and as we have quite a long time between flights in Changi (12 hours), we would like to make use of the transit hotel. However, as we will not be checked in from London straight through to Bali, we will have to reclaim our bags from the BA flight and then check in to the Jetstar one. As far as I can tell, both airlines use Terminal 1. My question is: will we be classed as transit passengers and therefore be able to use the transit hotel? My concern is that we will have to clear immigration in order to collect our bags, but then find that we are stuck landside and unable to use the hotel because check-in for our Jetstar flight to Bali doesn't open until several hours after our flight from London arrives. If anyone could put my mind at rest I'd be most grateful - thank you!","[Hi everyone, A quick question - ]we have booked through BA to travel to Bali, via Changi.

8,2,1,1,2270,"I appreciate that there are still alot of stranded people out there and I hope you all get home soon. but here was our story. I thought it best to wait 'till we all got home so we can give hopefully a balanced perspective of events. We were due to fly home on 15th April, when it all first happened from Atlanta. We were about 250 miles from the airport, just waking up in our hotel room when we heard the news on CNN, and obviously devastated. It was more the ""not knowing"" than anything else. The website (BA) told us not to go to the airport, and it was about 2.5 hours to speak to someone on the phone. We had to go and return the rental car anyway at ATL so had some hours to calm down and think a bit, rather than turn up to check in totally unaware and panic. The news in the U.S on this was fairly low key at the time from what we saw, and we got more information by logging on to UK news websites, it really felt like doom and gloom from what the media were saying. On our arrival at check in, we handed in my pre printed boarding passes to the BA check in staff, and decided just to book ourselves on the next available flight out, which was 6 days later.

We were about 250 miles from the airport, just waking up in our hotel room when we heard the news on CNN, and obviously devastated. It was more the ""not knowing"" than anything else. The website (BA) told us not to go to the airport, and it was about 2.5 hours to speak to someone on the phone. We had to go and return the rental car anyway at ATL so had some hours to calm down and think a bit, rather than turn up to check in totally unaware and panic. The news in the U.S on this was fairly low key at the time from what we saw, and we got more information by logging on to UK news websites, it really felt like doom and gloom from what the media were saying. On our arrival at check in, we handed in my pre printed boarding passes to the BA check in staff, and decided just to book ourselves on the next available flight out, which was 6 days later.

This is for all applications lodged *on or after* this date.

I accidently entered my last name on my mother's reservation to Italy and the mistake was not caught immediately. After reporting the problem via their website, I searched the internet to find all kinds of horrible results to similar situations including having to repurchase the ticket (without refund) at the current going rate. The current rate is now $500 more than it was a week ago! I would like to thank Shirley from International Reservations for her diligent persistence in helping me to correct a name error. Without her help, I would still be worrying whether TSA would allow my mother to fly with the ticket on which I incorrectly entered my last name instead of hers. Shirley was great and fixed the problem with no issue. She was polite during the entire transaction and gave me updates along the way so I would feel comfortable on hold. Thanks again for her help.

8,2,1,1,2366,"Yesterday I flew home from Jeddah via Doha on Qater Airways. On boarding the flight from Doha to Manchester it was quite chaotic in the forward economy cabin of the Airbus A330. Numerous families had unilaterally decided to seat themselves together regardless of their seat assignments. The poor FA spent 15 mins trying to get people into their correct seats. I reserved my usual aisle seat, but I had now been moved into a central aisle seat rather than my usual window aisle seat. I would hazard a guess this occurred to try and keep a family on the same row if possible, no big deal to be honest. However in my row was a mother and 2 children. The father of the family demanded rather than ask that I change seats with him, now if he'd been seated in business then fair enough, even accounting for his rather rude attitude. However he was seated in a centre seat behind me, I told him sorry but I dislike to being trapped in. He then became extremely rude, at which point I reported him to the FA. The FA had a word with him and he went off in Huff to his seat. Several hours later his young son looked at me and said "" your the nasty bl@@dy man who wouldn't move"" I guess that comment says it all really, clearly such language shouldn't come from a 3 yr old child. I have moved before to try and assist a family, as long as it's a similar seat close by then that's fine. This rather rude incident will definitely give me pause for thought in future. I think it was the overriding rude sense of entitlement that annoyed me.

Nobody was there to do the checkin for transit passengers. We requested assitance to the airport personnel, but they did not help at all and told us that I we did not want to loose the connection flight, we had to do custom clearance, get our luggage and do the check in again at the Qatar desk. The personnel of the airport was disrespectful and with a total lack of customer service attitude. We had little time to decide and we finally made to the check in counter of qatar at the airport. When we did the check in, we were charged 200.000 rp which I think is completely wrong. 1) The airport tax was included in my ticket as the regulation changed on February 2015, Denpasar Airport tax was included , as I booked my flight during Sept 2015. 2) We were passenger in transit that did not get any help from Qatar or airport personnel and we wanted to take our flight.

I've seen comments that say it's not that bad any more. But then again, I hear horrific stories.] If you've flown with Aeroflot recently, I'd love to hear your story, especially between Moscow-Tokyo.

8,2,1,1,2485,I was travelling on one of the trains from Manchester to London in late July. We ordered train tickets over the phone for a specified time (12:45pm) and got on the trian only to find out that we were given the wrong boarding passes (2:45pm). We noticed this after a request to show our tickets half-way enroute to London. The conductor on that train was so rude and didn't listen to any of our complaints and ended up slapping us in the face with a fine of 101 British pounds ($190) each with my travel compainion. Our efforts to discuss the matter with Virgin trains were turned away. On the same car another lady had the same problem but was welcomed with police at the train station in Euston because she failed to pay the fine. We had tickets and it wasn't our fault that we had boarded the train at the wriong time- in my opinion! To be fined extra fees yet the train had extra empty seats left a lot to be desired. Anyone with advice on how to handle this matter? Please write me back on allen.63@netzero.com Back in the U.S I run out of luck with limited help from the Headquaters of Virgin Atlantic in CT.
