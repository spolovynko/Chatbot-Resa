They are always packed with too few staff (counters & ""TSA"" checkpoints), the flights NEVER take off on time, you can't understand the PA system and a Coke costs 6 Euros. And, I have a problem every time I use Alitalia. They are famous for switching your seats if they have an Alitalia frequent flyer book after you who asks for your seats. They always give first priority to their own frequent flyers. It's happened to me three times now (most recently 9/14), so they still do it. You can go ahead book through Delta, but make sure that it's a Delta flight on Delta equipment. Otherwise, you're taking your chances.

I have just booked for August 2014 and it took a lot of compromise and change of planned dates to get flights. They are already almost fully booked for the school holidays as Disney are doing the dining plan again this year if you book before end of October so everyone is booking early. Of course there are other airlines that you can use but if you are want to use Virgin ( as we always do) don't hang around or you may be disappointed.,Just thought to mention this in case it helps anyone out.

I was flying Ork-Birmigham on an ATR72 (double prop plane with limited overhead baggage space). I fly this route relatively often - and as often as not hand luggage is take from you and put in the hold. Also - as often as not this plane runs at least 30 minutes late. So I arrive in Cork and would prefer not to have to have bags checked - but they are as its a pretty full flight. C'est la Vie. The flight leaves late due to late inbound craft -(which is a BS excuse really - - a more honest one would be the craft was late because its on an end to end schedule with very tight turnaround times, and we stuffed up somewhere earlier in the day) So I land an hour late and then have to wait for my bags - C'est la vie. On my return leg - I decide to ask at check in should I check my bag - I get advised that if I do there will be a charge (at least 50% of the time that i fly this route I am forced to check it - which of course is free - but I prefer not having to check it). I inform the staff member (Ms Ragdish) that i have no desire to check it, but will it be taken off me. She asks me to present it for weighing - and as it weighs 11KG she says I must pay 40£ to check it. I offered to take something out but she stated that then my laptop case would be over weight.

(Thanks to those of you on this forum that pointed out Ryanair don’t actually permit this; thankfully we were fine). I spent forever obsessing about my hand luggage and in the end opted to take only a rucksack – was only staying 3 nights. As soon as I arrived at the airport I headed straight to their bag measurers to ensure it was the right size. Turns out it could have been double the size and it would still have been okay. However, I needn’t have bothered because no one checked the size or weight of the bag before boarding either of the flights. In fact, as far as I could see no one on either of our flights had their bags checked. I did wonder though if this was because of flight was running late because as we were queuing to board we could see people departing the plane. Funnily enough we taxied right on time and for the return flight we left about 10 minutes late. I spent ages entering the online check in details as there’s a charge for entering information incorrectly. Again, I needn’t have bothered as the guy barely glanced my passport as he tore my boarding pass. When we did get onboard there did seem to be a problem with some people’s luggage as there wasn’t room overhead for everything but they managed to squeeze cases under some people’s seat. The plane seemed clean as far as I could see and the seats were comfy. Only criticism was that the seats did not recline nor were there any pockets on the back of the seat in front of you to store newspapers etc. I didn’t purchase any drinks or snacks as I took my own on board. And the little interaction I had with staff was pleasant enough. Another slightly annoying things was that my mum, who travels on a Barbados passport, had to have her boarding pass stamped before departure or she’s refused boarding. They make this very clear for the departure flight but I didn’t think it was necessary for the return flight. Praise God I decided to check to be on the safe side because it turns out it needs to be stamped in both directions. So, the nightmares I had in the lead up to the flight were unfounded. However, there was a couple at our hotel who flew out on another Ryanair flight and were charged the £40 for being a kilo over weight. To me it begged the question of whether there was something they could have thrown away and purchased once they landed but hey. Would I fly Ryanair again? Probably not of my choosing but if I absolutely had to then I guess I would as long as I was careful to follow all their rules.","This is not an airline I thought I would ever use.

Probably not of my choosing but if I absolutely had to then I guess I would as long as I was careful to follow all their rules.]",2664,2664,0,0

I was very apprehensive and expecting some delays, but everything was fine. We flew out of the Hamilton, Ontario, terminal and it was great! So compact, no walking, just park the car, walk in, check in, and on the plane. Wonderful compared to Pearson. Arrived in Dublin, Ireland on time. Flight over was in an older aircraft purchased from an Icelandic airline. We bought economy no frills and it was pretty tight for leg room. If you have long legs, spring for the premier. Other than that, it was just fine - plane left and arrived on time. On the flight home, we got a ""free"" meal and non alcoholic drinks, even though it said on the website you needed to preorder the meals. The people that preordered got a different meal (beef or pasta dish). We got a type of chili with vegetables and a bun with a dessert. Can't say every flight will go as smoothly, but I hope this will help with some of the apprehension involved with this airline.","Just wanted to relieve some of the anxiety for those of you who have booked flights with Globespan and heard the horror stories.

5,7,2,1,6667,"Feb 2nd, 2008 I was at Newark/Liberty airport to pick up a puppy that was being sent to me from a breeder in Texas. Unfortunately this breeder used American Airlines to transport the dog. I had used the useless flight tracker to get updated on the status of flight 558 and tracked the ""Airway Bill/Confirmation number"" to track as well. I called American Airlines Cargo prior to going to the airport. The flight was scheduled to arrive early and I took my family to the airport to pick up our new dog. After waiting for well over two hours after the flight landed, the people representing American Airlines Cargo could not give any information other than ""we don't know where the dog is, there were no dogs on flight 558"". They offered NO direction or help other than asking people to leave the carge office. In fact all four people behind the counter disappeared into a side ""break room"" with a poor attitude and suggessted we call in a few hours to see if the ""packages"" were found. Disgraceful. There were 11 families waiting and as this dragged on with absolutely no communication there was obviously frustration. The solution for the American Airlines employees was to call the airport security. These were families with children waiting and this was an absurd way to handle the situation. I called the breeder who could not get any information. I called American Airlines twice from my cell phone, only to be told that the dog in fact was at Newark airport as the flight had landed with the dog was on it. Not true but this was the only information available. Clearly no one knew what was going on and there is a serious flaw in their tracking capabilities. The fact that an error was made was not the issue. The complete inability of anyone representing AA at the airport or on the phone to address the situation was beyond irresponsible. The people in the cargo office were rude, unprofessional and dismissive. In fact, as we waited there were people from other flights coming to claim pets that were also lost because American Airlines never bothered to put them on the flight. AA systems are dangerously flawed. The employees are incompetenent, don't care and the airline is incapable of being trusted to transport an animal, child or anything of value. These puppies and family pets were left unattended in small crates for an unhealthy amount of time, neglected by American Airlines. They truly think of animals as nothing more than cargo and have zero concern for the health and well being of any animal they are transporting. If they can not responsibly transport a dog, YOU are not safe on this Airline. They have obviously stopped caring at all and should do us all a favor by declaring bancruptcy and get out of a business that has clearly passed them by.","Feb 2nd, 2008 I was at Newark/Liberty airport to pick up a puppy that was being sent to me from a breeder in Texas.

5,7,2,1,6717,"My family and I booked 4 tickets to New York for a week long stay, a week cruise, and then reurn home. Given that the day the ship returns to port, we will also have to fly back home, I called British Airways and asked in the slim possibility that Internet will not be avaialble on board the ship (distance, technical problems etc) what can be done if anything to ensure that all 4 family members can be together for the long flight back home. It is a very remote possibility that Internet will not be available on board the ship, but who knows.... I just wanted to make sure that we do not have any unplesant surprises. To my dismay they said that airport check-in is possible but do not guarantee that we will all be seated together. They asked for a total of 200EUR to preallocate the seats. I would expect this from a low-cost budget airline but certainly not from BA. I did not ask for a ticket change or any other upgrade or service (like extra luggage or preferential seating) I should pay for, but paying 5000EUR for 4 tickets and then being asked for another 200EUR for the simplest of service, it really bothers me. In my opinion this is a ""nickel and dime"" practice at best. I wrote them an email about it, and they did NOT even respond to it. I would at least expect a typical answer from them. Are my expectations unreasonable (do not overcharge for services, replay to complaint emails)????

5,7,2,1,6755,"Hi all, I booked a so-called 'Around the world' ticket with Travel-Nation, a UK based travel agency. They deal in multi-stop itineraries, on which special rules seem to apply. When they asked us for our passenger information we provided them with the correct information regarding first and last names. However, when they sent our itinerary, my first name was misspelled. I usually write my name as 'Luuk', while my passport says 'Lucas'. I remember signing emails with Luuk, yet I also know that I gave the correct passport names when asked. When I was at Heathrow airport I first encountered that the name on my ticket didnt match my passport. At that point it wasn't to big a deal, but I got to fly anyway. I tried to change my name at the AIR New Zealand service desk, but they couldnt do it and said that the travel agent had to do it. I'm currently in Australia after stopping over in Hong Kong. I could make all flights with the wrong name, even if that sometimes led to skewed faces. I've contacted the travel agent (Travel Nation) and asked them if they could change my name, since I provided them with the correct names. They told me it couldnt be done, since I already started travelling. Instead the added a note, stating that my first name was misspelled. In the accompanying email (in which my first name was misspelled again as Luuc!!!!!) they stated that 'this is not a guarantee for the USA'. So now I'm getting a bit freaked.

5,7,2,1,6779,"Just want to give others a heads up that Cheap Caribbean/Apple Group is a company with horrible business practices as well as customer support. Be very aware that when you click on accepting the terms of use this company will not compensate you for any errors they have made. Our experience is a result of this company not disclosing on their website they charge in US currency. However, looking through various sites even US based clients have had several issues regarding this company not providing compensation for legitimate complaints. I have sent the following email to the founder of Apple Leisure and the CEO and they refuse to respond. You will also notice the contact info for this company is very vague on their website. In short, we have booked vacations through many on-line companies that are ethical. THis one is not so do not expect any client support from them..... I am writing today to tell you how disappointed I am in your misleading business practices and disgusted I am with your customer support (a common thread in many reviews for your company). I shop on-line a lot and book trips through on-line travel sites so I am knowledgeable on how things work at check-out. I am from Canada and shop in the US, UK and, of course, Canada. We used Cheap Caribbean last year to book a trip and we were charged Canadian funds (funds were at par) and because of this we assumed your company charges us in our currency. There is NOTHING on the website or at checkout to indicate otherwise. For example, even when we book with Hotwire US we are quoted at checkout USD meaning the final price states clearly USD.

The zipped compartment inside was open and the clothes are all messed up(as messy as a 80% sale basket in the shopping mall), the wrapped present was torn open, wrapping paper and the pieces of present scattered around everywhere in the luggage. Furthermore, my boyfriend's mobile phone(old one with problem which we was thinking to get it fixed in China) and his suit (together with necktie and belt) were stolen!

Both going(30th Aug) and coming back(15th Sep), the luggages were spot checked as the suitcase locks were open when we got the luggages back (which we think by Russia Airport Authority as this has never happened since I have transited and been traveling around to any other countries). The going trip to Spain, both suitcase locks were open, broken lock for my boyfriend's case which he bought a new suitcase in Spain later. However, the real disaster was actually the coming back trip!! When we picked up the luggage, we found out that both luggages were broken, there are also 2 breakage spots on my luggage itself, the luggage handle came off and the locks were totally forced broken(so my boyfriend lost totally 2 suitcases for this trip). I have locked them before check-in and my suitcase is the type that came with international lock that can be opened by international key in case the luggage would be spot checked by any airport authority so it should not be forced open in such manner! That aside, when we got home, I opened the luggage just to find out that the things inside were totally flipped over in a big mess! The zipped compartment inside was open and the clothes are all messed up(as messy as a 80% sale basket in the shopping mall), the wrapped present was torn open, wrapping paper and the pieces of present scattered around everywhere in the luggage. Furthermore, my boyfriend's mobile phone(old one with problem which we was thinking to get it fixed in China) and his suit (together with necktie and belt) were stolen! The box of mobile phone was left behind together with the torn open plastic suit bag but both of the items were no where to be found! I tried to call the airline but nobody picked up, now I'm waiting for the reply email which I don't know whether they will even cared to read. Frankly speaking, I have no hope that they will contact us back. So this post is only an example and a warning for you guys to be careful and choose the airline wisely (we bought it because it was the cheapest flight ticket, an obviously resulted as an expensive lesson). For us, this is the first and will be the last time we will ever fly with Aeroflot or transit via Russia. With what had happened, we would not hesitate to pay 100-200 EUR more to get a better flight that transit elsewhere!!!]",2458,2458,0,0

Checking in at Manaus airport for the flight Manaus to Fortaleza, flight made by the Brazilian company GOL, they refused to let me check in.

With United-Air Canada booked through United, I could use the AC locater provided by United on the AC web site to get to my reservation. Seems a bit different this time.]",1033,1033,0,0

5,7,2,1,6981,"I was surprised to discover recently that I am only a few hundred miles away from Medallion Status on Delta. I say ""surprised"" because I generally don't fly enough in a year to get the necessary mileage for any kind of airline status. However in this case I benefited from a couple of trips to the west coast earlier in the year, plus two sizable MQM bonuses that I received courtesy of my Skymiles credit card. I have some long haul trips planned for later this year and early next, so decided to have a go at a Mileage Run to get the remaining miles for the status upgrade. Since I'm new to doing Mileage Runs, I decided to try something not too terribly ambitious - just enough miles to push me over the threshold. I've read that ATL is not a great airport to base out of for this sort of activity, but I did find an inexpensive R/T flight to Louisville that departs on a weekday afternoon, has a short layover at SDF, and then returns to ATL by about 8:00 PM on the same day. It cost about $145 altogether and I'll get 1000 miles out of it - not such a great deal in terms of cost per mile, but for a first effort I guess it's not too bad (plus it's a small financial investment if I have to back out at the last minute out for some reason). Anyway, here's my question. My biggest concern with this is that something will happen in Louisville (delays, etc) and I will miss the return flight to Atlanta. Both flights have the same flight number so I am guessing it's the same physical airplane for both legs. Does anyone have any idea if that's a valid assumption? I figure worst case I can do a one-way car rental and drive home (6 hours) if I miss the return, but would obviously rather fly (note that I only need the outgoing miles for the status upgrade, so no real harm done if that happens). That's really all I wanted to know, I guess. I know that FlyerTalk is probably a better venue to discuss this sort of thing, but I am not active over there (yet!). My wife is very dubious about all of this and thinks I am crazy, so I am just trying to allay some concerns.

During closures, the arrival rate at SFO will be reduced from 60 aircraft per hour to 30 aircraft per hour. Delays for flights originating within a two-hour radius of SFO are expected to occur during peak travel times. Peak times are between 9:00 a.m. to12:00 p.m., and 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Travelers are strongly encouraged to contact their respective carriers regarding any potential delays."" flysfo.com/web/…updates The dates listed are ...

Runways 28-L and 28-R are used for long haul takeoffs and for virtually all landings.

These airports cover most of the west coast, from San Diego (SAN) in the south to Portland (PDX - my home) in the north. Seattle is a 2hr15 flight from SFO, so may not be immune. These delays already happen when bad weather hits SFO, as flights from nearby airports are subject to flow control.

Well, the day of our flight, there was a major North Eastern snowstorm. EVery flight out of our city was cancelled. Not my fault. Not Aeromexico's fault. These things happen. So, I called them to see how they were going to handle it. They said a refund was not an option. Fine. Act of God, whatever. So they said they would rebook my flight at a different date but they were sold out until the end of the month. And oh, by the way, I would have to pay the difference between the original ticket price and they ticket price of a different date----which was $500 more than the original ticket price, because the only tickets they had available were during the high season. I think that's poor customer service, but okay. Fine. The guy said I had 10 months to redeem it. Well, I called back three weeks later to rebook it, and he said that I only had two days to rebook the flight, that time had passed, they were taking my money and they would not be giving it back. NO ONE told me this when I talked to them originally. They made it very clear I had up to ten months to rebook it at no charge except for any difference in the ticket price. I explained this and asked to speak to a manager or supervisor. The guy on the phone was *extremely* rude though I was trying to stay calm and cordial with him. I asked 4 times before he finally agreed to let me speak to a supervisor. At which time, he put me on hold and left me there for 45 minutes. Finally, I hung up and called back. The same jerk answered the phone. I tried asking to speak to a supervisor again, and he hung up on me. What. The hell. Do NOT book through Aeromexico for any reason.

I was caught in the Oh s$#% time frame of under 3 weeks and over 2 weeks so I could not make appointment at the Miami passport agency . I scrambled 2 and 1/2 weeks till travel date what should I do? I panicked, I read horror stories and read great stories online. What should I do I ask my self. Wait 1/2 a weeks to make a appointment and hope I can get one before my travel date. One of the passport agency worker actually in a way suggested I should wait and set a appointment. I was scared its almost june summer is here its travel season. If I wait I risk not getting appointment in time. Three phone calls to the passport agency and I get a old man Nice calming voice in my state of panic telling me to expediate it. At the time expediated was 2-3 weeks and the clerk at courts said its the 3 week mark. The passport agent told me do it, my response was what if I don't get it in time he stated "" I had a get out of jail free card."" At 4 days prior to departure if the application is good I can request a emergancey appointment with the Miami agency.. This gave me the kick in the but to expediate it and the relief I had a back up plan.. I herd rumors that the passport agency is the only functional branch of government now I can say confidently that these people are efficient. It only took 7 days, thats right 7 days not business days but days to get it to my door. I right this so the people who are stuck on the fence at the 2-3 week mark and are scared, don't be scared.

I was caught in the Oh s$#% time frame of under 3 weeks and over 2 weeks so I could not make appointment at the Miami passport agency . I scrambled 2 and 1/2 weeks till travel date what should I do? I panicked, I read horror stories and read great stories online. What should I do I ask my self. Wait 1/2 a weeks to make a appointment and hope I can get one before my travel date. One of the passport agency worker actually in a way suggested I should wait and set a appointment. I was scared its almost june summer is here its travel season. If I wait I risk not getting appointment in time. Three phone calls to the passport agency and I get a old man Nice calming voice in my state of panic telling me to expediate it. At the time expediated was 2-3 weeks and the clerk at courts said its the 3 week mark. The passport agent told me do it, my response was what if I don't get it in time he stated "" I had a get out of jail free card."" At 4 days prior to departure if the application is good I can request a emergancey appointment with the Miami agency.. This gave me the kick in the but to expediate it and the relief I had a back up plan.. I herd rumors that the passport agency is the only functional branch of government now I can say confidently that these people are efficient.

Hot meals will be included on all Trans-Atlantic and Pacifc international flights again from all UA airports in all classes. Here is the email: Dear Mr.(snip), Thank you for your direct, candid feedback on the test we had planned to launch in the fourth quarter for food choices on some of our flights. We heard you and have decided not to move forward with the test of offering customers buy-on-board options in United Economy on certain trans-Atlantic flights. We will continue to offer complimentary hot meals on those flights. The response from you and many of our corporate customers, even before we launched the test, told us what we would have undoubtedly learned had we proceeded - you value our hot meal service in economy class for international flights. In this environment, where higher costs driven by volatile fuel prices are now the norm, we must continue to tailor products and services so that we provide you with choices and competitive fares. As such, we will continue to be proactive in testing new ideas. On October 1, we will proceed with the test of new, complimentary options for United Business customers on three-cabin aircraft used for domestic routes, which represents 16 daily flights. Customers on these flights will receive complimentary fresh sandwiches, salads, breakfast, snack boxes or snacks, depending on the length of flight and time of departure. They will also continue to enjoy complimentary beverages, including beer, wine and cocktails. We will evaluate the results and determine next steps by the end of the year. It's also important to note that full meals will still be served on our p.s. transcontinental flights. Thank you again for your feedback. We will continue to listen and make changes that enable us in this environment to provide you with the choices you value.

First, it does confirm what I suspect most people know to be reality.. that being the **average** air fare paid today is in fact LOWER than what you paid **on average** back in 1995 when adjusted for inflation.. Again, this is an average and applies to only US carriers.. but I do think that it applies to most markets-- some more than others, but most markets..

5,7,2,1,7224,"Here is the description of my terrible experience with FlightNetwork: I needed to book round trip tickets to Copenhagen for 3 people. We searched Google flights for the best deal and found a round trip flight for $843 from Flight Network. Since we needed to book using 3 different credit cards, I called FlightNetwork for the booking to ensure that we all get the same price and availability. First, it takes the agent forever to find the flight I am talking about (even using the flight numbers). Then, the agent tells me that the price I am seeing is due to a “glitch” in the system but they would honour this price. I am put on hold for long periods of time in order for the agent to come to this conclusion. It is already 30 minutes that I’m on the call and I have no new information other than the information I already had accessed online in less than 2 minutes. I tell the agent I would like to book with 3 credit cards and apply a promo code (for $20 discount per booking). The agent then asks me for the credit card numbers. Without asking me for my promo code, she has already applied a random promo code that gives $10 discount. I was frustrated at the incompetence of the agent and the long wait times so I decided I would continue the transaction online. I hang up with the agent, go through the online booking system, put in my credit card, click on “Purchase Now”, only to get a pop up that says the online system could not confirm my fare. I refresh the page and suddenly the flight is showing up at $896. I call back 5 minutes after I’ve hung up with the agent the first time, and she tells me that flight prices have gone up. I now decide to proceed with the booking anyway as it is urgent enough for me to book this flight. Another 45 minutes goes by, again long hold times, and my 3 flights are now booked. I receive emails with details of the booking but no invoice. I told myself I would call the next day to ask about the invoice. The next day, I notice the flight is showing at $843 again! And, on top of that, when I log in to the Air Canada website to manage my booking, the purchase price is actually at $843. So when I call back FlightNetwork, I tell them about this and I also tell them that I can’t even confirm what has been charged because I never received an invoice. Again, more ridiculously long hold times - every time, I ask a question, the agent tells me to hold on, puts me on hold for 5-10 minutes and comes back throwing up an answer she received from someone else. What is the point of customer care agents when they have to consult every question. Initially, the agent tells me that she says I was charged $843 mistakenly. I am so confused. Then, she comes back and says oh no, it was $896 that you were charged. Complete chaos!! She sends me the invoice which says that I am paying $285 for the flight and $611.57 in taxes totalling $896.57. Then I tell her that the flight is back to $843 on their website. She says she cannot see this price in their database. I am literally refreshing the page as I speak to the agent and am seeing $843. I had to send a screenshot of what I am seeing on their website to them to prove that I am seeing this price!! She then says that because the flight is book, she cannot refund the difference but can provide it as a credit due to their price drop protection. I was not satisfied with this but looked like I didn’t have another option so I agree and she tells me that it will appear in my account within 3-5 business days. It has been 4 and still nothing but we will see. During the call, I ask to speak with a supervisor and she tells me that the supervisor will basically tell me the same thing… The total time for this call was 1 hour. Then I finally see the charge on my credit card - I see 2 charges. One with the description AIR CANADA totalling $843 and another with description TASF totalling $53. I google TASF and find out this mean travel agent service fee. I am so furious now as they never informed me that this was part of the price they quoted to me!! It is not even detailed in the invoice. I tried calling and the agent tells me that this doesn’t need to be detailed to me, it is part of the total price but I am still not convinced. This is only $53 but the principle of the matter, I was not informed of the details of the charges to my credit card, let alone the absolutely horrible service, I am sure this is in violation of some consumer protection act or travel agents act.

Embarrassing that this is a Canadian company.","[Here is the description of my terrible experience with FlightNetwork: I needed to book round trip tickets to Copenhagen for 3 people. We searched Google flights for the best deal and found a round trip flight for $843 from Flight Network. Since we needed to book using 3 different credit cards, I called FlightNetwork for the booking to ensure that we all get the same price and availability. First, it takes the agent forever to find the flight I am talking about (even using the flight numbers). Then, the agent tells me that the price I am seeing is due to a “glitch” in the system but they would honour this price. I am put on hold for long periods of time in order for the agent to come to this conclusion. It is already 30 minutes that I’m on the call and I have no new information other than the information I already had accessed online in less than 2 minutes. I tell the agent I would like to book with 3 credit cards and apply a promo code (for $20 discount per booking). The agent then asks me for the credit card numbers. Without asking me for my promo code, she has already applied a random promo code that gives $10 discount. I was frustrated at the incompetence of the agent and the long wait times so I decided I would continue the transaction online. I hang up with the agent, go through the online booking system, put in my credit card, click on “Purchase Now”, only to get a pop up that says the online system could not confirm my fare. I refresh the page and suddenly the flight is showing up at $896. I call back 5 minutes after I’ve hung up with the agent the first time, and she tells me that flight prices have gone up. I now decide to proceed with the booking anyway as it is urgent enough for me to book this flight. Another 45 minutes goes by, again long hold times, and my 3 flights are now booked. I receive emails with details of the booking but no invoice. I told myself I would call the next day to ask about the invoice. The next day, I notice the flight is showing at $843 again! And, on top of that, when I log in to the Air Canada website to manage my booking, the purchase price is actually at $843. So when I call back FlightNetwork, I tell them about this and I also tell them that I can’t even confirm what has been charged because I never received an invoice. Again, more ridiculously long hold times - every time, I ask a question, the agent tells me to hold on, puts me on hold for 5-10 minutes and comes back throwing up an answer she received from someone else. What is the point of customer care agents when they have to consult every question. Initially, the agent tells me that she says I was charged $843 mistakenly. I am so confused. Then, she comes back and says oh no, it was $896 that you were charged. Complete chaos!! She sends me the invoice which says that I am paying $285 for the flight and $611.57 in taxes totalling $896.57. Then I tell her that the flight is back to $843 on their website. She says she cannot see this price in their database. I am literally refreshing the page as I speak to the agent and am seeing $843. I had to send a screenshot of what I am seeing on their website to them to prove that I am seeing this price!! She then says that because the flight is book, she cannot refund the difference but can provide it as a credit due to their price drop protection. I was not satisfied with this but looked like I didn’t have another option so I agree and she tells me that it will appear in my account within 3-5 business days. It has been 4 and still nothing but we will see. During the call, I ask to speak with a supervisor and she tells me that the supervisor will basically tell me the same thing… The total time for this call was 1 hour. Then I finally see the charge on my credit card - I see 2 charges. One with the description AIR CANADA totalling $843 and another with description TASF totalling $53. I google TASF and find out this mean travel agent service fee. I am so furious now as they never informed me that this was part of the price they quoted to me!! It is not even detailed in the invoice. I tried calling and the agent tells me that this doesn’t need to be detailed to me, it is part of the total price but I am still not convinced. This is only $53 but the principle of the matter, I was not informed of the details of the charges to my credit card, let alone the absolutely horrible service, I am sure this is in violation of some consumer protection act or travel agents act.

They made us wait for over an hour for a voucher for Lunch and then we got $5, which doesn't buy much more than a coffee at Pearson International. We paid for Premium seats because we had heard the seats were tight and then ours seats were double booked. We were worried about lost bags and went with carry on. When we arrived there were people that had lost luggage, I felt especiaily sad for this young teenage girl who was in tears on the bus ride to the resort. Coming home was no better. Web check in wasn't even offered on the way back Delays again coming home and the sign at the gate continued to read on time, even though they were not. They forced us to check our bags or pay several hundred dollars to carry them on even though we had less then when we went down and the bags were standard carry size for any other airline. We arrived so late that we had to pay for a hotel stay at the airport when we got back. On the 7.5 hour flight down we had one drink service that happened 3.5 hours after we boarded.

We lost a whole day in Rome b/c Delta has no clue how to properly service their planes. The flight crew was impolite and unhelpful, not to mention misleading in keeping passengers up to date on when we'd be back on schedule to our destination. Since we came home and shared this experience with friends and family we've heard that our story is nothing new. Delta has a well established reputation for messing up travel plans of passengers.

I had a connecting flight later so i had to fly that day. I was forced to book another flight which left in two hours and cost alot more than the original. thank god they had another flight with space on it otherwise i would have missed my connecting flight too. I arrived back on the 11th and have since been trying to contact them. on their website they have a UK number which apparently is open 24 hrs. The number is not recognised, i called the Bravo Fly car service to try and get transferred. I spoke to a very grumpy man telling me its a completely different company and he is getting ridiculous amounts of calls everyday regarding the same thing! I have been basically been robbed and this could have turned out alot worse than it did had i missed my connecting flight. Please if anybody has a contact number for email for them please let me ]know.",1381,86,0.9377262853,1

5,7,2,1,7436,"Hi, has anyone had any problems with HMPO online form when submiting their passport application? I applied for my first adult passport in July/2014 by using the online form available. Approximately six weeks later I received a letter saying I needed to complete a whole new form, this time in paper form. I contacted HMPO and asked why, since my application was complete and with no errors. They told me it was because I had missed Section 4 (details on parents). I went back into the online form, this time taking screen shots with date and time, and surprise, surprise there was no Section 4 in the online version of the form. I was never given the opportunity to write my parents details. I repeated the process several times in different dates and managed to get to the end of the form (screen to complete payment and submit). I tried contacting them by phone, but they insisted that despite the problem I had to go through the whole process again. I tried complaining, had no replies. Phoned again several times, then they finally said they could not find my application, then later on they ""found"" it but that there was no way around it. As a result I have waited for my passport to be processed for more than 8 weeks now - and still no idea when it will be finalised. I read in a similar trip advisor forum (""Problems with the Passport Office,dated April 2014) that some people, Miss B and Nanny503927 for example, were having similar problems.

I therefore had some trepidation about the flight, figuring it would be a royal PITA, no food, and generally where the end would justify the means. Wrong. I chose British Airways Open Skies from Newark to Orly because I had always had good experiences with BA. Also, I liked the idea of a smaller plane with less people. It seemed to be a bit more civilized. I was not disappointed even though we traveled economy. The seats were leather and comfy, and not quite as narrow as some. Our seats were the first row in economy, so although not separated by a wall, there was a lot of leg space between our seats and the last row of business class. We were not treated as if we were the inferior class. We received iPads, a full meal which was quite good, as well as a small breakfast snack before landing...all at no additional cost. Upon the return we were two in three seats, which was terrific. We had a sizable snack, a full meal which was also quite good and another snack prior to landing. The flight crew (captain et al) on both flights were terrific....informative and very personable. The flight attendants were very pleasant, professional and helpful...and love the uniforms as they have a chic retro vibe. Along with the pillow and blanket we received a packet with eye shades, socks, and another item I can't recall. Boarding and disembarking were both a breeze although upon Orly arrival we did not have jetway access but had to disembark on the airfield where a bus waited to take us to the terminal. On the return to Newark we hit a wind shear upon touch down which the female pilot handled very admirably. Luggage retrieval was painless...again, due to far fewer passengers. One point...the 757-200 is a narrow body jet. Therefore the aisles are narrower than many other types of aircraft. Therefore, any bump in the air will cause you to bump the passenger in the seat if walking in the aisle, or be bumped if you are seated. Other than that, the flight was like flying used to be, when passengers were treated like humans, and not cattle. IMO, all,others airlines should,take a page out of the BAOS book. I would fly them again in a heartbeat. Now all they need to add is in flight WiFi, and the service would be perfect.","I have not flown internationally in a long time....or even domestically since the invention of the TSA.

Other than that, the flight was like flying used to be, when passengers were treated like humans, and not cattle. IMO, all,others airlines should,take a page out of the BAOS book. I would fly them again in a heartbeat. Now all they need to add is in flight WiFi, and the service would be perfect.","I have not flown internationally in a long time....or even domestically since the invention of the TSA. I therefore had some trepidation about the flight, figuring it would be a royal PITA, no food, and generally where the end would justify the means. Wrong. I chose British Airways Open Skies from Newark to Orly because I had always had good experiences with BA. Also, I liked the idea of a smaller plane with less people. It seemed to be a bit more civilized. I was not disappointed even though we traveled economy. The seats were leather and comfy, and not quite as narrow as some. Our seats were the first row in economy, so although not separated by a wall, there was a lot of leg space between our seats and the last row of business class. We were not treated as if we were the inferior class. We received iPads, a full meal which was quite good, as well as a small breakfast snack before landing...all at no additional cost. Upon the return we were two in three seats, which was terrific. We had a sizable snack, a full meal which was also quite good and another snack prior to landing. The flight crew (captain et al) on both flights were terrific....informative and very personable. The flight attendants were very pleasant, professional and helpful...and love the uniforms as they have a chic retro vibe. Along with the pillow and blanket we received a packet with eye shades, socks, and another item I can't recall. Boarding and disembarking were both a breeze although upon Orly arrival we did not have jetway access but had to disembark on the airfield where a bus waited to take us to the terminal. On the return to Newark we hit a wind shear upon touch down which the female pilot handled very admirably. Luggage retrieval was painless...again, due to far fewer passengers.

I tried to be as specific as possible as to the assistance I needed since I was traveling alone. These requests were not out of line and should have all been provided by Allegiant. Instead, Allegiant asked my family member who was dropping me off at the airport to help me to my gate which was a huge inconvieniece for them. On my first leg the gate was changed before the flight and another passenger had to move me to the new gate. But that was nothing compared to how I found my wheelchair every time I received it back from Allegiant after landing. After the first leg, the left arm rest was broken off. I didn't say anything at that time thinking that it was just a ""things happen"" situation. I really lost it though when at the end of my second leg, as I was being wheeled down the ramp, the young man who was wheeling me down wheeled my left wheel partially on the edge of the ramp causing the rubber tire to come off my wheel!!

Now though, I'm house bound because they just didn't care to take care of something that is so important to me. I did contact them, I guess they have 30 days to respond.","[I have read several other posts on here about Allegiant Airlines and Disabled individuals expecting to receive more services than they are actually due because of their disabled status. I want to make sure you know I'm not one of those people. When booking my trip I did request assistance from Allegiant with my luggage, moving through the airport and security, to the gate, and on and off the plane. I tried to be as specific as possible as to the assistance I needed since I was traveling alone. These requests were not out of line and should have all been provided by Allegiant. Instead, Allegiant asked my family member who was dropping me off at the airport to help me to my gate which was a huge inconvieniece for them. On my first leg the gate was changed before the flight and another passenger had to move me to the new gate. But that was nothing compared to how I found my wheelchair every time I received it back from Allegiant after landing. After the first leg, the left arm rest was broken off. I didn't say anything at that time thinking that it was just a ""things happen"" situation. I really lost it though when at the end of my second leg, as I was being wheeled down the ramp, the young man who was wheeling me down wheeled my left wheel partially on the edge of the ramp causing the rubber tire to come off my wheel!! Then he started telling me how it was ""normal wear and tear"". REALLY?!?! When my husband and I got back to our car we inspected the chair closer and found that the edge of the back of the chair had a rip in the vinyl!!

Once on board the plane I was put next to a small baby and on asking the cabin crew if I could be moved as I did not want to give the child my germs, I was rudely told that there was nothing they could do for me. All in all my flight from the moment of check in to when I landed was an absolute nightmare. ]Have other passengers had the bad luck of dealing with rude and unhelpful Qatar Airways staff?",809,0,1,1

I fly this route relatively often - and as often as not hand luggage is take from you and put in the hold. Also - as often as not this plane runs at least 30 minutes late. So I arrive in Cork and would prefer not to have to have bags checked - but they are as its a pretty full flight. C'est la Vie. The flight leaves late due to late inbound craft -(which is a BS excuse really - - a more honest one would be the craft was late because its on an end to end schedule with very tight turnaround times, and we stuffed up somewhere earlier in the day) So I land an hour late and then have to wait for my bags - C'est la vie. On my return leg - I decide to ask at check in should I check my bag - I get advised that if I do there will be a charge (at least 50% of the time that i fly this route I am forced to check it - which of course is free - but I prefer not having to check it). I inform the staff member (Ms Ragdish) that i have no desire to check it, but will it be taken off me. She asks me to present it for weighing - and as it weighs 11KG she says I must pay 40£ to check it. I offered to take something out but she stated that then my laptop case would be over weight.

And this was how I was repayed What a lousy customer loyalty reward. Then the PLane ran 75 minutes late.

(Thanks to those of you on this forum that pointed out Ryanair don’t actually permit this; thankfully we were fine). I spent forever obsessing about my hand luggage and in the end opted to take only a rucksack – was only staying 3 nights. As soon as I arrived at the airport I headed straight to their bag measurers to ensure it was the right size. Turns out it could have been double the size and it would still have been okay. However, I needn’t have bothered because no one checked the size or weight of the bag before boarding either of the flights. In fact, as far as I could see no one on either of our flights had their bags checked. I did wonder though if this was because of flight was running late because as we were queuing to board we could see people departing the plane. Funnily enough we taxied right on time and for the return flight we left about 10 minutes late. I spent ages entering the online check in details as there’s a charge for entering information incorrectly. Again, I needn’t have bothered as the guy barely glanced my passport as he tore my boarding pass. When we did get onboard there did seem to be a problem with some people’s luggage as there wasn’t room overhead for everything but they managed to squeeze cases under some people’s seat. The plane seemed clean as far as I could see and the seats were comfy. Only criticism was that the seats did not recline nor were there any pockets on the back of the seat in front of you to store newspapers etc. I didn’t purchase any drinks or snacks as I took my own on board. And the little interaction I had with staff was pleasant enough. Another slightly annoying things was that my mum, who travels on a Barbados passport, had to have her boarding pass stamped before departure or she’s refused boarding. They make this very clear for the departure flight but I didn’t think it was necessary for the return flight. Praise God I decided to check to be on the safe side because it turns out it needs to be stamped in both directions. So, the nightmares I had in the lead up to the flight were unfounded. However, there was a couple at our hotel who flew out on another Ryanair flight and were charged the £40 for being a kilo over weight. To me it begged the question of whether there was something they could have thrown away and purchased once they landed but hey. Would I fly Ryanair again? Probably not of my choosing but if I absolutely had to then I guess I would as long as I was careful to follow all their rules.","This is not an airline I thought I would ever use.

However, there was a couple at our hotel who flew out on another Ryanair flight and were charged the £40 for being a kilo over weight. To me it begged the question of whether there was something they could have thrown away and purchased once they landed but hey. Would I fly Ryanair again? Probably not of my choosing but if I absolutely had to then I guess I would as long as I was careful to follow all their rules.","[This is not an airline I thought I would ever use. However, I booked a short break and only at the end of the booking did the lady mention it was a Ryanair flight. (Thanks to those of you on this forum that pointed out Ryanair don’t actually permit this; thankfully we were fine). I spent forever obsessing about my hand luggage and in the end opted to take only a rucksack – was only staying 3 nights. As soon as I arrived at the airport I headed straight to their bag measurers to ensure it was the right size. Turns out it could have been double the size and it would still have been okay. However, I needn’t have bothered because no one checked the size or weight of the bag before boarding either of the flights. In fact, as far as I could see no one on either of our flights had their bags checked. I did wonder though if this was because of flight was running late because as we were queuing to board we could see people departing the plane. Funnily enough we taxied right on time and for the return flight we left about 10 minutes late. I spent ages entering the online check in details as there’s a charge for entering information incorrectly. Again, I needn’t have bothered as the guy barely glanced my passport as he tore my boarding pass. When we did get onboard there did seem to be a problem with some people’s luggage as there wasn’t room overhead for everything but they managed to squeeze cases under some people’s seat. The plane seemed clean as far as I could see and the seats were comfy. Only criticism was that the seats did not recline nor were there any pockets on the back of the seat in front of you to store newspapers etc. I didn’t purchase any drinks or snacks as I took my own on board. And the little interaction I had with staff was pleasant enough. Another slightly annoying things was that my mum, who travels on a Barbados passport, had to have her boarding pass stamped before departure or she’s refused boarding. They make this very clear for the departure flight but I didn’t think it was necessary for the return flight. Praise God I decided to check to be on the safe side because it turns out it needs to be stamped in both directions.] So, the nightmares I had in the lead up to the flight were unfounded.

Flight over was in an older aircraft purchased from an Icelandic airline. We bought economy no frills and it was pretty tight for leg room. If you have long legs, spring for the premier.

On the flight home, we got a ""free"" meal and non alcoholic drinks, even though it said on the website you needed to preorder the meals.

5,3,2,1,6667,"Feb 2nd, 2008 I was at Newark/Liberty airport to pick up a puppy that was being sent to me from a breeder in Texas. Unfortunately this breeder used American Airlines to transport the dog. I had used the useless flight tracker to get updated on the status of flight 558 and tracked the ""Airway Bill/Confirmation number"" to track as well. I called American Airlines Cargo prior to going to the airport. The flight was scheduled to arrive early and I took my family to the airport to pick up our new dog. After waiting for well over two hours after the flight landed, the people representing American Airlines Cargo could not give any information other than ""we don't know where the dog is, there were no dogs on flight 558"". They offered NO direction or help other than asking people to leave the carge office. In fact all four people behind the counter disappeared into a side ""break room"" with a poor attitude and suggessted we call in a few hours to see if the ""packages"" were found. Disgraceful. There were 11 families waiting and as this dragged on with absolutely no communication there was obviously frustration. The solution for the American Airlines employees was to call the airport security. These were families with children waiting and this was an absurd way to handle the situation. I called the breeder who could not get any information. I called American Airlines twice from my cell phone, only to be told that the dog in fact was at Newark airport as the flight had landed with the dog was on it. Not true but this was the only information available. Clearly no one knew what was going on and there is a serious flaw in their tracking capabilities. The fact that an error was made was not the issue. The complete inability of anyone representing AA at the airport or on the phone to address the situation was beyond irresponsible. The people in the cargo office were rude, unprofessional and dismissive. In fact, as we waited there were people from other flights coming to claim pets that were also lost because American Airlines never bothered to put them on the flight. AA systems are dangerously flawed. The employees are incompetenent, don't care and the airline is incapable of being trusted to transport an animal, child or anything of value. These puppies and family pets were left unattended in small crates for an unhealthy amount of time, neglected by American Airlines. They truly think of animals as nothing more than cargo and have zero concern for the health and well being of any animal they are transporting. If they can not responsibly transport a dog, YOU are not safe on this Airline. They have obviously stopped caring at all and should do us all a favor by declaring bancruptcy and get out of a business that has clearly passed them by.","Feb 2nd, 2008 I was at Newark/Liberty airport to pick up a puppy that was being sent to me from a breeder in Texas.

Given that the day the ship returns to port, we will also have to fly back home, I called British Airways and asked in the slim possibility that Internet will not be avaialble on board the ship (distance, technical problems etc) what can be done if anything to ensure that all 4 family members can be together for the long flight back home. It is a very remote possibility that Internet will not be available on board the ship, but who knows.... I just wanted to make sure that we do not have any unplesant surprises. To my dismay they said that airport check-in is possible but do not guarantee that we will all be seated together. They asked for a total of 200EUR to preallocate the seats. I would expect this from a low-cost budget airline but certainly not from BA. I did not ask for a ticket change or any other upgrade or service (like extra luggage or preferential seating) I should pay for, but paying 5000EUR for 4 tickets and then being asked for another 200EUR for the simplest of service, it really bothers me. In my opinion this is a ""nickel and dime"" practice at best. I wrote them an email about it, and they did NOT even respond to it. I would at least expect a typical answer from them. Are my expectations unreasonable (do not overcharge for services, replay to complaint emails)????

When they asked us for our passenger information we provided them with the correct information regarding first and last names. However, when they sent our itinerary, my first name was misspelled. I usually write my name as 'Luuk', while my passport says 'Lucas'. I remember signing emails with Luuk, yet I also know that I gave the correct passport names when asked. When I was at Heathrow airport I first encountered that the name on my ticket didnt match my passport. At that point it wasn't to big a deal, but I got to fly anyway. I tried to change my name at the AIR New Zealand service desk, but they couldnt do it and said that the travel agent had to do it. I'm currently in Australia after stopping over in Hong Kong. I could make all flights with the wrong name, even if that sometimes led to skewed faces. I've contacted the travel agent (Travel Nation) and asked them if they could change my name, since I provided them with the correct names. They told me it couldnt be done, since I already started travelling. Instead the added a note, stating that my first name was misspelled. In the accompanying email (in which my first name was misspelled again as Luuc!!!!!) they stated that 'this is not a guarantee for the USA'. So now I'm getting a bit freaked.

Be very aware that when you click on accepting the terms of use this company will not compensate you for any errors they have made. Our experience is a result of this company not disclosing on their website they charge in US currency. However, looking through various sites even US based clients have had several issues regarding this company not providing compensation for legitimate complaints. I have sent the following email to the founder of Apple Leisure and the CEO and they refuse to respond. You will also notice the contact info for this company is very vague on their website. In short, we have booked vacations through many on-line companies that are ethical. THis one is not so do not expect any client support from them..... I am writing today to tell you how disappointed I am in your misleading business practices and disgusted I am with your customer support (a common thread in many reviews for your company). I shop on-line a lot and book trips through on-line travel sites so I am knowledgeable on how things work at check-out. I am from Canada and shop in the US, UK and, of course, Canada. We used Cheap Caribbean last year to book a trip and we were charged Canadian funds (funds were at par) and because of this we assumed your company charges us in our currency. There is NOTHING on the website or at checkout to indicate otherwise. For example, even when we book with Hotwire US we are quoted at checkout USD meaning the final price states clearly USD. Cheap Caribbean does not specify anywhere on the website or on our ticket voucher you charge in USD. There is nothing in your contract either to indicate you charge in USD. We were pretty shocked when we were billed $450+ more than we were invoiced for on our credit card. When I called customer care indicating I expect a refund the differance I was informed by a robotic like human ...we are a US company we charge in USD. I could not get Bobby to understand the issue is not that you charge in USD, you don't tell your customers you charge USD. A call to the supervisor was a waste of time. He could care less. The LAST think a customer wants to here is ""we are not doing anything for you"". So, as a result of this I have filed a complaint with the BBB and had several conversations with my friends and coworkers telling them how misleading this company is and all I spoke to are shocked you do not indicate what currency you charge in. Your refusal to pay back what you should not have charged in the first place will cost you a lot of future business. Your lack of action speaks volumes about your business practices (shady) and you lack of interest in customer satisfaction. Also, you may want to have a supervisor train your service reps. When asked ``How are you`the response of `I am okay`is not professional at all. In addition, perhaps educate your staff that a .com company does not indicate you are US based.

Both going(30th Aug) and coming back(15th Sep), the luggages were spot checked as the suitcase locks were open when we got the luggages back (which we think by Russia Airport Authority as this has never happened since I have transited and been traveling around to any other countries). The going trip to Spain, both suitcase locks were open, broken lock for my boyfriend's case which he bought a new suitcase in Spain later. However, the real disaster was actually the coming back trip!! When we picked up the luggage, we found out that both luggages were broken, there are also 2 breakage spots on my luggage itself, the luggage handle came off and the locks were totally forced broken(so my boyfriend lost totally 2 suitcases for this trip). I have locked them before check-in and my suitcase is the type that came with international lock that can be opened by international key in case the luggage would be spot checked by any airport authority so it should not be forced open in such manner! That aside, when we got home, I opened the luggage just to find out that the things inside were totally flipped over in a big mess! The zipped compartment inside was open and the clothes are all messed up(as messy as a 80% sale basket in the shopping mall), the wrapped present was torn open, wrapping paper and the pieces of present scattered around everywhere in the luggage. Furthermore, my boyfriend's mobile phone(old one with problem which we was thinking to get it fixed in China) and his suit (together with necktie and belt) were stolen! The box of mobile phone was left behind together with the torn open plastic suit bag but both of the items were no where to be found! I tried to call the airline but nobody picked up, now I'm waiting for the reply email which I don't know whether they will even cared to read. Frankly speaking, I have no hope that they will contact us back. So this post is only an example and a warning for you guys to be careful and choose the airline wisely (we bought it because it was the cheapest flight ticket, an obviously resulted as an expensive lesson). For us, this is the first and will be the last time we will ever fly with Aeroflot or transit via Russia. With what had happened, we would not hesitate to pay 100-200 EUR more to get a better flight that transit elsewhere!!!","My boyfriend and I made a trip to Spain(Hong Kong-Madrid and Madrid- Hong Kong).

The flight itself was made by TAP Portugal. The journey to Manaus was perfect, but on my return happened an unexpected problem. Checking in at Manaus airport for the flight Manaus to Fortaleza, flight made by the Brazilian company GOL, they refused to let me check in. My seat was reserved, but, it seemed that the ticket was not payed by TAP. Even showing my e-ticket and proof of my payment, they refused to let me board. It was at that moment not possible to contact TAP in Brazil or Ebookers. The only way to take that flight was to by another ticket at the GOL-gate, witch costed me 781,00 euro! Arriving at Fortaleza Airport, I adressed myself to the TAP office. They gave me a mailadress where I could make my complaint. Back home, I adressed my complaint first to TAP, but the only answer I received was that I had to fill in the form on their website, witch I did, without any further respons. Since I booked my trip trough Ebookers.be, I repeated my complaint to that company, also by filling in a form on their ""customer-service"" website. You receive an automatic answer with a registration-number and the promise they would answer within 48 hours. 5 days later, I still had no answer. I send them a reminder, but even 2 weeks later, there was no further respons. I send Ebookers another, rather angry mail, on witch they responded the same day with excuses for the delay and the answer that they transmitted my complaint to TAP and that I could expect a compensation by TAP for the extra cost I had to make. Now, 3 months further, I still have no answer or payment by TAP or Ebookers. I presume that mail with complaints are directly transmitted to the ""unwanted mail"" or the ""trash"" map!

5,3,2,1,6975,"I made the unfortunate mistake of booking an emergency trip to the UK thru Minneapolis to LGW with Northwest. In the past I always had good luck with MSP but apparently they have been in the midst of runway work and flights are delayed or cancelled willy nilly (although you can bet it's the smaller cities whose flights are cancelled), Couldn't get into Minn to connect with the UK flight and NW ""service"" was little help. Apparently this has been going on frequently, yesterday the flight got to Minn too late to make the connection. If we had been warned earlier in the day, we could have driven to MSP in 4 hours and made the connection. All NW would offer by phone was a late Thurs flight to Detroit that got into LGW on Friday far too late for us. This suggestion also made it clear that NW wasn't going to guarantee we would be able to get to MSP Thursday eiher. Luckily we listened to the business travelers in line and did not trust the info given by phone, so we stayed in line and the in-person clerk (who was also helping unload planes at the same time) was able to reroute us to get to LGW three hours earlier which gives us a good shot at making the services. It may take all of Thursday to get to Gatwick but at least it's a chance if it all goes well. To add insult to this, while on hold with NW, they were playing an ad offering bonus miles to fly into Msp!!! If they had any kind of conscience they would be warning potential passengers of the delays and they all should change their schedules to avoid these delays. Oh, but then they might lose business, better to have a captive angry passenger than no passenger at all.

There was a time when I really did enjoy traveling, but that was before the hubs, maximizing seat capacity, disappearance of snacks and cancelling flights to make sure the other flights have no empty seats.","[I made the unfortunate mistake of booking an emergency trip to the UK thru Minneapolis to LGW with Northwest. ]In the past I always had good luck with MSP but apparently they have been in the midst of runway work and flights are delayed or cancelled [willy nilly (although you can bet it's the smaller cities whose flights are cancelled), Couldn't get into Minn to connect with the UK flight and NW ""service"" was little help. Apparently this has been going on frequently, yesterday the flight got to Minn too late to make the connection. If we had been warned earlier in the day, we could have driven to MSP in 4 hours and made the connection. All NW would offer by phone was a late Thurs flight to Detroit that got into LGW on Friday far too late for us. This suggestion also made it clear that NW wasn't going to guarantee we would be able to get to MSP Thursday eiher. Luckily we listened to the business travelers in line and did not trust the info given by phone, so we stayed in line and the in-person clerk (who was also helping unload planes at the same time) was able to reroute us to get to LGW three hours earlier which gives us a good shot at making the services. It may take all of Thursday to get to Gatwick but at least it's a chance if it all goes well. To add insult to this, while on hold with NW, they were playing an ad offering bonus miles to fly into Msp!!! If they had any kind of conscience they would be warning potential passengers of the delays and they all should change their schedules to avoid these delays. Oh, but then they might lose business, better to have a captive angry passenger than no passenger at all. I have not flown United for quite a number of years since that summer period when they were also stranding passengers in Denver and Chicago.

5,3,2,1,6981,"I was surprised to discover recently that I am only a few hundred miles away from Medallion Status on Delta. I say ""surprised"" because I generally don't fly enough in a year to get the necessary mileage for any kind of airline status. However in this case I benefited from a couple of trips to the west coast earlier in the year, plus two sizable MQM bonuses that I received courtesy of my Skymiles credit card. I have some long haul trips planned for later this year and early next, so decided to have a go at a Mileage Run to get the remaining miles for the status upgrade. Since I'm new to doing Mileage Runs, I decided to try something not too terribly ambitious - just enough miles to push me over the threshold. I've read that ATL is not a great airport to base out of for this sort of activity, but I did find an inexpensive R/T flight to Louisville that departs on a weekday afternoon, has a short layover at SDF, and then returns to ATL by about 8:00 PM on the same day. It cost about $145 altogether and I'll get 1000 miles out of it - not such a great deal in terms of cost per mile, but for a first effort I guess it's not too bad (plus it's a small financial investment if I have to back out at the last minute out for some reason). Anyway, here's my question. My biggest concern with this is that something will happen in Louisville (delays, etc) and I will miss the return flight to Atlanta. Both flights have the same flight number so I am guessing it's the same physical airplane for both legs. Does anyone have any idea if that's a valid assumption? I figure worst case I can do a one-way car rental and drive home (6 hours) if I miss the return, but would obviously rather fly (note that I only need the outgoing miles for the status upgrade, so no real harm done if that happens). That's really all I wanted to know, I guess. I know that FlyerTalk is probably a better venue to discuss this sort of thing, but I am not active over there (yet!). My wife is very dubious about all of this and thinks I am crazy, so I am just trying to allay some concerns.

As we are now Coeliacs (no Gluten) we just booked the basic meals eg Chicken and plain rice. Once on board the meals were served and thats when we noticed the ingredients list on the packaging (contains gluten) so we could not eat the food i explained to staff they said to contact customer services and explain. On arrival I contacted Airasia via the website and explained everything eg, The website states that some of the meals may contain gluten, When in fact ALL of the meals had gluten, so I requested a refund of the return flights pre-booked meals which was some 10 days away. This request was of course rejected but i was given a link to the site again to select and pay for new meals lol that of course i cant eat any. Plus Airasia have a 'no outside food policy' I had anticipated that the level of service from them would be zero, so we did bring some snacks. The moral of the story use yoru mastercard as I did and dispute the transaction on return then they wil actually listen as the Booking was made from the UK our rules apply regardless of the lack of clarity on the Airasia site so I will update the outcome, for me its not about the £20 its more about the priciple now so fight on ;)","Hi we recently arrived back from a trip and took flights with Airasia form KUL to CEB we had pre-booked meals for both flights along with exit seats.

In this environment, where higher costs driven by volatile fuel prices are now the norm, we must continue to tailor products and services so that we provide you with choices and competitive fares. As such, we will continue to be proactive in testing new ideas.

Customers on these flights will receive complimentary fresh sandwiches, salads, breakfast, snack boxes or snacks, depending on the length of flight and time of departure. They will also continue to enjoy complimentary beverages, including beer, wine and cocktails. We will evaluate the results and determine next steps by the end of the year.

5,3,2,1,7224,"Here is the description of my terrible experience with FlightNetwork: I needed to book round trip tickets to Copenhagen for 3 people. We searched Google flights for the best deal and found a round trip flight for $843 from Flight Network. Since we needed to book using 3 different credit cards, I called FlightNetwork for the booking to ensure that we all get the same price and availability. First, it takes the agent forever to find the flight I am talking about (even using the flight numbers). Then, the agent tells me that the price I am seeing is due to a “glitch” in the system but they would honour this price. I am put on hold for long periods of time in order for the agent to come to this conclusion. It is already 30 minutes that I’m on the call and I have no new information other than the information I already had accessed online in less than 2 minutes. I tell the agent I would like to book with 3 credit cards and apply a promo code (for $20 discount per booking). The agent then asks me for the credit card numbers. Without asking me for my promo code, she has already applied a random promo code that gives $10 discount. I was frustrated at the incompetence of the agent and the long wait times so I decided I would continue the transaction online. I hang up with the agent, go through the online booking system, put in my credit card, click on “Purchase Now”, only to get a pop up that says the online system could not confirm my fare. I refresh the page and suddenly the flight is showing up at $896. I call back 5 minutes after I’ve hung up with the agent the first time, and she tells me that flight prices have gone up. I now decide to proceed with the booking anyway as it is urgent enough for me to book this flight. Another 45 minutes goes by, again long hold times, and my 3 flights are now booked. I receive emails with details of the booking but no invoice. I told myself I would call the next day to ask about the invoice. The next day, I notice the flight is showing at $843 again! And, on top of that, when I log in to the Air Canada website to manage my booking, the purchase price is actually at $843. So when I call back FlightNetwork, I tell them about this and I also tell them that I can’t even confirm what has been charged because I never received an invoice. Again, more ridiculously long hold times - every time, I ask a question, the agent tells me to hold on, puts me on hold for 5-10 minutes and comes back throwing up an answer she received from someone else. What is the point of customer care agents when they have to consult every question. Initially, the agent tells me that she says I was charged $843 mistakenly. I am so confused. Then, she comes back and says oh no, it was $896 that you were charged. Complete chaos!! She sends me the invoice which says that I am paying $285 for the flight and $611.57 in taxes totalling $896.57. Then I tell her that the flight is back to $843 on their website. She says she cannot see this price in their database. I am literally refreshing the page as I speak to the agent and am seeing $843. I had to send a screenshot of what I am seeing on their website to them to prove that I am seeing this price!! She then says that because the flight is book, she cannot refund the difference but can provide it as a credit due to their price drop protection. I was not satisfied with this but looked like I didn’t have another option so I agree and she tells me that it will appear in my account within 3-5 business days. It has been 4 and still nothing but we will see. During the call, I ask to speak with a supervisor and she tells me that the supervisor will basically tell me the same thing… The total time for this call was 1 hour. Then I finally see the charge on my credit card - I see 2 charges. One with the description AIR CANADA totalling $843 and another with description TASF totalling $53. I google TASF and find out this mean travel agent service fee. I am so furious now as they never informed me that this was part of the price they quoted to me!! It is not even detailed in the invoice. I tried calling and the agent tells me that this doesn’t need to be detailed to me, it is part of the total price but I am still not convinced. This is only $53 but the principle of the matter, I was not informed of the details of the charges to my credit card, let alone the absolutely horrible service, I am sure this is in violation of some consumer protection act or travel agents act. Overall absolutely terrible terrible nightmarish experience with FlightNetwork. Not worth the headache and lack of transparency. Embarrassing that this is a Canadian company.","Here is the description of my terrible experience with FlightNetwork: I needed to book round trip tickets to Copenhagen for 3 people. We searched Google flights for the best deal and found a round trip flight for $843 from Flight Network. Since we needed to book using 3 different credit cards, I called FlightNetwork for the booking to ensure that we all get the same price and availability. First, it takes the agent forever to find the flight I am talking about (even using the flight numbers). Then, the agent tells me that the price I am seeing is due to a “glitch” in the system but they would honour this price. I am put on hold for long periods of time in order for the agent to come to this conclusion. It is already 30 minutes that I’m on the call and I have no new information other than the information I already had accessed online in less than 2 minutes. I tell the agent I would like to book with 3 credit cards and apply a promo code (for $20 discount per booking). The agent then asks me for the credit card numbers. Without asking me for my promo code, she has already applied a random promo code that gives $10 discount. I was frustrated at the incompetence of the agent and the long wait times so I decided I would continue the transaction online.

We booked extra legroom seats and we felt the cost was worth it. Seat Selection: This was done online as well and it was simple. My only complaint is that we wanted two aisle seats and it wouldn't let me. Online Check in: I checked in a week ahead of time and printed boarding passes. Again, simple and easy. Night before luggage drop: We dropped off our luggage the night before with no stress or problems. I love being able to do this. Flight: Boarding was on time and very efficient. We did take off about 20 minutes later than planned. The flight was comfortable. We had bought a Boots Meal deal at the airport before we went to the plan. So, we did not purchase anything on the plane. We booked extra space seats and they were good value for my tall husband. The flight is about 3 hours from Manchester. Luggage & Immigration in Naples: we disembarked quickly upon landing to a bus. At immigration, the lines went quickly. We had a little wait for the luggage and then off to our transfer. From landing to our transport heading to Sorrento, it took about 1 1/2 hours. The return trip was just as simple and easy. We were pleased with our flights and now look forward to our trip on the Dreamliner this summer.","I thought I would share our experience. If you have any questions, please ask.

5,3,2,1,7287,"Since Usairways merger with American our service and prices have suffered out of Charlotte. My last experience made me vow to never fly them unless I absolutely had to. My wife and I just returned from a round trip via Delta from Charlotte to Jacksonville, FL. We flew first class cheaper than a coach seat on AA. From the moment we stepped up to the ticket counter in Charlotte until we got our baggage back at the end of the trip, it was amazing to experience the difference in service. The comparison between first class on Delta and first class on AA is amazing.

There were no Pre-Boarding areas for Executive or Business classes at the gate. The ground servive at BLR was also very inefficient and transit service at BOM was HORRIBLE. The flight from BOM to EWR on 747 was acceptable with good inflight food service, but non-existent entertainment and the seats were not flat.

Their security staff is rude and there is no concept of organized boarding at Heathrow. Incidentally, there is barely enough time to exit the plane with all your belongings, go through security and make it back to the gate before the plane is supposed to leave.

I had purchased tickets for my wife, daughter, and myself online with no problems. Upon arrival at Zacatecas (ZCL) for our flight to Chicago Midway (MDW), they said ""the system"" wouldn't let them check her in because she's two years old (despite the obvious fact to the contrary according to her Mexican *and* US passports). They couldn't get ""el sistema"" to let them issue a boarding pass because we were within the month that she turned two (she was 1 year, 11 months). They gave us the ultimatum: buy a full price ticket or don't fly. Not wanting to miss Thanksgiving dinner, we caved. But, as they were trying to buy the ticket for her as an adult ""el sistema"" wouldn't let them because she was not yet two years old!!! They eventually lied, entered an older age, and gave us the Customer Service number and email address for a refund. Essentially the *same* thing happened on the return flight... except this time they said they had absolutely no record of her ticket and forced us to buy another one. Naturally, customer service at Volaris is a joke in English or Spanish. In Spanish, they'll talk down to you, tell you it was your fault, and stonewall you. They'll refuse to let you speak to a supervisor. In English, they'll sound very nice and helpful and then do nothing, saying they'll call you back after checking with the airport for more details. Surprise, surprise, they never call back. If you then call them back, the supervisor (if you're lucky enough to get one... usually the reps just refuse to connect you) will not take your call, leaving you on hold for hours. If you hang up and work your way through Customer Service to the same supervisor... he'll tell his reps to tell you ""he'll call you right back."" Two months later, and many, many hours on the phone, still no refund. Next stop PROFECO? Anyone else have this problem?

Upon arrival at Zacatecas (ZCL) for our flight to Chicago Midway (MDW), they said ""the system"" wouldn't let them check her in because she's two years old (despite the obvious fact to the contrary according to her Mexican *and* US passports). They couldn't get ""el sistema"" to let them issue a boarding pass because we were within the month that she turned two (she was 1 year, 11 months). They gave us the ultimatum: buy a full price ticket or don't fly. Not wanting to miss Thanksgiving dinner, we caved. But, as they were trying to buy the ticket for her as an adult ""el sistema"" wouldn't let them because she was not yet two years old!!! They eventually lied, entered an older age, and gave us the Customer Service number and email address for a refund. Essentially the *same* thing happened on the return flight... except this time they said they had absolutely no record of her ticket and forced us to buy another one. Naturally, customer service at Volaris is a joke in English or Spanish. In Spanish, they'll talk down to you, tell you it was your fault, and stonewall you. They'll refuse to let you speak to a supervisor. In English, they'll sound very nice and helpful and then do nothing, saying they'll call you back after checking with the airport for more details. Surprise, surprise, they never call back. If you then call them back, the supervisor (if you're lucky enough to get one... usually the reps just refuse to connect you) will not take your call, leaving you on hold for hours. If you hang up and work your way through Customer Service to the same supervisor... he'll tell his reps to tell you ""he'll call you right back.""

Approximately six weeks later I received a letter saying I needed to complete a whole new form, this time in paper form. I contacted HMPO and asked why, since my application was complete and with no errors. They told me it was because I had missed Section 4 (details on parents). I went back into the online form, this time taking screen shots with date and time, and surprise, surprise there was no Section 4 in the online version of the form. I was never given the opportunity to write my parents details. I repeated the process several times in different dates and managed to get to the end of the form (screen to complete payment and submit). I tried contacting them by phone, but they insisted that despite the problem I had to go through the whole process again. I tried complaining, had no replies.

I booked some flights and elected to pay by Direct Deposit to avoid the credit card surcharge. As my bank is the same as theirs the transaction was processed immediately. Two working days later when I checked my itinerary, it was flagged as pending, unpaid. As when I had originally made the payment it said that the booking would only be held for two days I was a little concerned and phoned their customer service department. When I eventually got through, after some discussion I was asked to send a copy of my bank's confirmation of payment, which I duly did. Later that day I found the itinerary was now marked as paid so I was happy enough with that. However, this morning a Jetstar rep called me to check that everything was now OK and ask if I had received my itinerary (which I had). Not only that, but she had to call four times before I was available to take the call, which I thought was pretty good follow up, I would have thought they'd give up after the second try. They did leave voice mail, but only to say they wanted to speak with me personally, so they also didn't take that out and call it good. I was impressed, better service than I expected.","I know Jetstar gets a lot of bagging but I thought I'd relate an instance of good customer service I just received from them.

5,3,2,1,7456,"I have not flown internationally in a long time....or even domestically since the invention of the TSA. I therefore had some trepidation about the flight, figuring it would be a royal PITA, no food, and generally where the end would justify the means. Wrong. I chose British Airways Open Skies from Newark to Orly because I had always had good experiences with BA. Also, I liked the idea of a smaller plane with less people. It seemed to be a bit more civilized. I was not disappointed even though we traveled economy. The seats were leather and comfy, and not quite as narrow as some. Our seats were the first row in economy, so although not separated by a wall, there was a lot of leg space between our seats and the last row of business class. We were not treated as if we were the inferior class. We received iPads, a full meal which was quite good, as well as a small breakfast snack before landing...all at no additional cost. Upon the return we were two in three seats, which was terrific. We had a sizable snack, a full meal which was also quite good and another snack prior to landing. The flight crew (captain et al) on both flights were terrific....informative and very personable. The flight attendants were very pleasant, professional and helpful...and love the uniforms as they have a chic retro vibe. Along with the pillow and blanket we received a packet with eye shades, socks, and another item I can't recall. Boarding and disembarking were both a breeze although upon Orly arrival we did not have jetway access but had to disembark on the airfield where a bus waited to take us to the terminal. On the return to Newark we hit a wind shear upon touch down which the female pilot handled very admirably. Luggage retrieval was painless...again, due to far fewer passengers. One point...the 757-200 is a narrow body jet. Therefore the aisles are narrower than many other types of aircraft. Therefore, any bump in the air will cause you to bump the passenger in the seat if walking in the aisle, or be bumped if you are seated. Other than that, the flight was like flying used to be, when passengers were treated like humans, and not cattle. IMO, all,others airlines should,take a page out of the BAOS book. I would fly them again in a heartbeat. Now all they need to add is in flight WiFi, and the service would be perfect.","I have not flown internationally in a long time....or even domestically since the invention of the TSA.

[Although the voucher has a telephone number on it to call to redeem - when I tried that I was told ""no you have to go into the office in the city"" and not only that you cant also use FF points to top up the price of the flights you want to buy. ]I wanted two return tics ADL MEL next weekend. They were going to cost $360 each anyway with Q. Sooo gave up and booked on line with Virgin for $198.00 each return.

All flights and airlines have been great - even EasyJet (!) - with the glaring exception of British Airways.

I want to make sure you know I'm not one of those people. When booking my trip I did request assistance from Allegiant with my luggage, moving through the airport and security, to the gate, and on and off the plane. I tried to be as specific as possible as to the assistance I needed since I was traveling alone. These requests were not out of line and should have all been provided by Allegiant. Instead, Allegiant asked my family member who was dropping me off at the airport to help me to my gate which was a huge inconvieniece for them. On my first leg the gate was changed before the flight and another passenger had to move me to the new gate. But that was nothing compared to how I found my wheelchair every time I received it back from Allegiant after landing. After the first leg, the left arm rest was broken off. I didn't say anything at that time thinking that it was just a ""things happen"" situation. I really lost it though when at the end of my second leg, as I was being wheeled down the ramp, the young man who was wheeling me down wheeled my left wheel partially on the edge of the ramp causing the rubber tire to come off my wheel!! Then he started telling me how it was ""normal wear and tear"". REALLY?!?! When my husband and I got back to our car we inspected the chair closer and found that the edge of the back of the chair had a rip in the vinyl!! It's going to cost me more to repair this chair than it will to just replace it. What makes me so angry is that no one says sorry. My husband worked for an entire day to make this chair fit my personality by painting it sparkly hot pink since I have to spend so much time in it.

The only information I sent them was a standard letter which you can find the template for on moneysavingexpert.com. I had the original eticket from my email inbox but no other information ie boarding passes etc so if you do decide to try and claim this should be the only thing you need to attach to the letter. Also they did send me an email with an offer of a voucher to be redeemed on a future Thomas cook holiday (expires in 12 months) but as I am unable to do that I have asked them to send me a cheque which you are legally entitled to do. From sending the letter to receiving the email today it only took 13 days for a resolution.

I was flying Ork-Birmigham on an ATR72 (double prop plane with limited overhead baggage space). I fly this route relatively often - and as often as not hand luggage is take from you and put in the hold. Also - as often as not this plane runs at least 30 minutes late. So I arrive in Cork and would prefer not to have to have bags checked - but they are as its a pretty full flight. C'est la Vie. The flight leaves late due to late inbound craft -(which is a BS excuse really - - a more honest one would be the craft was late because its on an end to end schedule with very tight turnaround times, and we stuffed up somewhere earlier in the day) So I land an hour late and then have to wait for my bags - C'est la vie. On my return leg - I decide to ask at check in should I check my bag - I get advised that if I do there will be a charge (at least 50% of the time that i fly this route I am forced to check it - which of course is free - but I prefer not having to check it). I inform the staff member (Ms Ragdish) that i have no desire to check it, but will it be taken off me. She asks me to present it for weighing - and as it weighs 11KG she says I must pay 40£ to check it. I offered to take something out but she stated that then my laptop case would be over weight. So I had to pay 40£ to have a suitcase taken off me that would have been taken off me anyway. I only offered as having flown the route many times I wanted to assist on making things run smoother. And this was how I was repayed What a lousy customer loyalty reward. Then the PLane ran 75 minutes late. Michael O'Leary from Ryan Air decided a year and a half ago that it wasnt a good idea to muck about as much on luggage restrictions - and moved away from it in favour of better customer services. Aer lingus have apparently decided to try and see if they can make that failed policy work. Can I ask the question of Aer Lingus - If you try to emulate his failed baggage policy, could I implore you to try and at least aim for his successful on time policy?

On my return leg - I decide to ask at check in should I check my bag - I get advised that if I do there will be a charge (at least 50% of the time that i fly this route I am forced to check it - which of course is free - but I prefer not having to check it). I inform the staff member (Ms Ragdish) that i have no desire to check it, but will it be taken off me. She asks me to present it for weighing - and as it weighs 11KG she says I must pay 40£ to check it. I offered to take something out but she stated that then my laptop case would be over weight. So I had to pay 40£ to have a suitcase taken off me that would have been taken off me anyway. I only offered as having flown the route many times I wanted to assist on making things run smoother. And this was how I was repayed What a lousy customer loyalty reward. Then the PLane ran 75 minutes late. Michael O'Leary from Ryan Air decided a year and a half ago that it wasnt a good idea to muck about as much on luggage restrictions - and moved away from it in favour of better customer services. Aer lingus have apparently decided to try and see if they can make that failed policy work. Can I ask the question of Aer Lingus - If you try to emulate his failed baggage policy, could I implore you to try and at least aim for his successful on time policy?

(Thanks to those of you on this forum that pointed out Ryanair don’t actually permit this; thankfully we were fine). I spent forever obsessing about my hand luggage and in the end opted to take only a rucksack – was only staying 3 nights. As soon as I arrived at the airport I headed straight to their bag measurers to ensure it was the right size. Turns out it could have been double the size and it would still have been okay. However, I needn’t have bothered because no one checked the size or weight of the bag before boarding either of the flights. In fact, as far as I could see no one on either of our flights had their bags checked. I did wonder though if this was because of flight was running late because as we were queuing to board we could see people departing the plane. Funnily enough we taxied right on time and for the return flight we left about 10 minutes late. I spent ages entering the online check in details as there’s a charge for entering information incorrectly. Again, I needn’t have bothered as the guy barely glanced my passport as he tore my boarding pass. When we did get onboard there did seem to be a problem with some people’s luggage as there wasn’t room overhead for everything but they managed to squeeze cases under some people’s seat. The plane seemed clean as far as I could see and the seats were comfy. Only criticism was that the seats did not recline nor were there any pockets on the back of the seat in front of you to store newspapers etc. I didn’t purchase any drinks or snacks as I took my own on board. And the little interaction I had with staff was pleasant enough. Another slightly annoying things was that my mum, who travels on a Barbados passport, had to have her boarding pass stamped before departure or she’s refused boarding. They make this very clear for the departure flight but I didn’t think it was necessary for the return flight. Praise God I decided to check to be on the safe side because it turns out it needs to be stamped in both directions. So, the nightmares I had in the lead up to the flight were unfounded. However, there was a couple at our hotel who flew out on another Ryanair flight and were charged the £40 for being a kilo over weight. To me it begged the question of whether there was something they could have thrown away and purchased once they landed but hey. Would I fly Ryanair again? Probably not of my choosing but if I absolutely had to then I guess I would as long as I was careful to follow all their rules.","This is not an airline I thought I would ever use.

5,1,2,1,6667,"Feb 2nd, 2008 I was at Newark/Liberty airport to pick up a puppy that was being sent to me from a breeder in Texas. Unfortunately this breeder used American Airlines to transport the dog. I had used the useless flight tracker to get updated on the status of flight 558 and tracked the ""Airway Bill/Confirmation number"" to track as well. I called American Airlines Cargo prior to going to the airport. The flight was scheduled to arrive early and I took my family to the airport to pick up our new dog. After waiting for well over two hours after the flight landed, the people representing American Airlines Cargo could not give any information other than ""we don't know where the dog is, there were no dogs on flight 558"". They offered NO direction or help other than asking people to leave the carge office. In fact all four people behind the counter disappeared into a side ""break room"" with a poor attitude and suggessted we call in a few hours to see if the ""packages"" were found. Disgraceful. There were 11 families waiting and as this dragged on with absolutely no communication there was obviously frustration. The solution for the American Airlines employees was to call the airport security. These were families with children waiting and this was an absurd way to handle the situation. I called the breeder who could not get any information. I called American Airlines twice from my cell phone, only to be told that the dog in fact was at Newark airport as the flight had landed with the dog was on it. Not true but this was the only information available. Clearly no one knew what was going on and there is a serious flaw in their tracking capabilities. The fact that an error was made was not the issue. The complete inability of anyone representing AA at the airport or on the phone to address the situation was beyond irresponsible. The people in the cargo office were rude, unprofessional and dismissive. In fact, as we waited there were people from other flights coming to claim pets that were also lost because American Airlines never bothered to put them on the flight. AA systems are dangerously flawed. The employees are incompetenent, don't care and the airline is incapable of being trusted to transport an animal, child or anything of value. These puppies and family pets were left unattended in small crates for an unhealthy amount of time, neglected by American Airlines.

5,1,2,1,6703,"The topic of airfare price drops has been done to death I guess but I'll give it another whack. Is Air Canada the worst offender? I am not an experienced air traveller but I was very surprised to find the airfare for the same flights I booked in early February from Australia to Vancouver return (Sep/Oct travel) have dropped by 25% six weeks later! I booked the cheapest fare (economy tango) for my family on our first international trip and I chose Air Canada because it is a direct flight and we have limited time during school holidays. The airlines seem to know when it is holiday time and bump up the prices. I have to say 25% is a significant price drop for the same class seats on the same flights. I am disappointed at losing $2000 and it is an unfortunate lesson. If I could afford the higher fares I gather the tickets would be refundable and I would not lose out, except for the nasty cancellation fee. My tickets are not refundable and I am informed there is no option to rebook at the new lower fare. I wouldn't mind so much if the price drop wasn't so large. If this is a normal occurrence it seems booking with Air Canada is like spending money on a lottery ticket.","The topic of airfare price drops has been done to death I guess but I'll give it another whack.

Given that the day the ship returns to port, we will also have to fly back home, I called British Airways and asked in the slim possibility that Internet will not be avaialble on board the ship (distance, technical problems etc) what can be done if anything to ensure that all 4 family members can be together for the long flight back home. It is a very remote possibility that Internet will not be available on board the ship, but who knows.... I just wanted to make sure that we do not have any unplesant surprises.

I would expect this from a low-cost budget airline but certainly not from BA. I did not ask for a ticket change or any other upgrade or service (like extra luggage or preferential seating) I should pay for, but paying 5000EUR for 4 tickets and then being asked for another 200EUR for the simplest of service, it really bothers me. In my opinion this is a ""nickel and dime"" practice at best. I wrote them an email about it, and they did NOT even respond to it. I would at least expect a typical answer from them.

5,1,2,1,6762,"Hi, I have pre booked the escape lounge for my son and myself. I am concerned about dress code as my son wears trainers or plimsolls or flip flops for holidays. Its really not suitable to wear his leather shoes just to enter the lounge and then be burdened with them all holiday. I have read reviews where members seem to have a pompous attitude to dress code and snub any form of casual sports wear. My son looks very respectable in his fashion wear and is clean and tidy. I have worked in office environments where business men dressed in suits are offensive due to their uncleanliness but because it is a suit and looks business it is deemed. Dress code is surely subjective for an airport lounge where people are meant to be in holiday mode! Shouldn't the fact that a person is be clean and tidy and respectful be more important than what line of attire they are wearing? I totally agree that a person should dress respectful in terms of not revealing too much flesh but reasonable length shorts and trainers...what is the problem?

Our experience is a result of this company not disclosing on their website they charge in US currency. However, looking through various sites even US based clients have had several issues regarding this company not providing compensation for legitimate complaints. I have sent the following email to the founder of Apple Leisure and the CEO and they refuse to respond. You will also notice the contact info for this company is very vague on their website. In short, we have booked vacations through many on-line companies that are ethical. THis one is not so do not expect any client support from them..... I am writing today to tell you how disappointed I am in your misleading business practices and disgusted I am with your customer support (a common thread in many reviews for your company). I shop on-line a lot and book trips through on-line travel sites so I am knowledgeable on how things work at check-out. I am from Canada and shop in the US, UK and, of course, Canada. We used Cheap Caribbean last year to book a trip and we were charged Canadian funds (funds were at par) and because of this we assumed your company charges us in our currency. There is NOTHING on the website or at checkout to indicate otherwise. For example, even when we book with Hotwire US we are quoted at checkout USD meaning the final price states clearly USD. Cheap Caribbean does not specify anywhere on the website or on our ticket voucher you charge in USD. There is nothing in your contract either to indicate you charge in USD. We were pretty shocked when we were billed $450+ more than we were invoiced for on our credit card. When I called customer care indicating I expect a refund the differance I was informed by a robotic like human ...we are a US company we charge in USD. I could not get Bobby to understand the issue is not that you charge in USD, you don't tell your customers you charge USD. A call to the supervisor was a waste of time. He could care less. The LAST think a customer wants to here is ""we are not doing anything for you"". So, as a result of this I have filed a complaint with the BBB and had several conversations with my friends and coworkers telling them how misleading this company is and all I spoke to are shocked you do not indicate what currency you charge in. Your refusal to pay back what you should not have charged in the first place will cost you a lot of future business. Your lack of action speaks volumes about your business practices (shady) and you lack of interest in customer satisfaction. Also, you may want to have a supervisor train your service reps. When asked ``How are you`the response of `I am okay`is not professional at all. In addition, perhaps educate your staff that a .com company does not indicate you are US based.

Other than asking twice for the 1-800 number and never getting it, we did arrive safely in NY two hours late which is not horrible for LaGuardia. However, upon returning and calling the 1-800 number I was informed that since I did check luggage and did use 3 seats - I would not have any money refunded. So you can get less that what you paid for --- even on a budget airline.",1444,0,1,1

5,1,2,1,6904,"Flew yesterday from Manchester to Orlando. Routing was originally via Atlanta with 4 hour layover prior to onward to MCO. 10 pax with reserved seating in economy. All pretty routine. Half of party arrives at MAN and calls me as checking out hotel, Atlanta flight overbooked. Heart sinks as travelling first time where it is just me with three sons, and sons girlfriend. So as I am mentally thinking EU261 rules, this is quickly followed up by they want to know if we are willing to switch to non stop flight leaving 30 minutes later. Heck yes, especially with a PE upgrade thrown in. 747-400 (Barbarella): great IFE, pretty good food (chicken well spicy must have read the tomato juice experiment), excellent attentive service. Seat are good pitch, but for me are not the most comfortable with headrest adjustment poor. Economy on way home is going too be a let down for the kids, hey ho. MCO arrival was excellent. We were an hour from wheels down to driving out the rental car garage. Immigration was empty, used new kiosks which worked for 7 out of 10 including sons girlfriend who had not travelled before. We did go through recheck for 3 as their receipts had a cross on. I know some have reported this process being done twice over, with some work to rule type approach but for me it was only for issues with taking finger scan. Grabbed bags, hit the tram and out. So great experience all round, even saw the Dreamliner at MAN ;-) Now just need to ask an EU261 compensation questions and complain about not getting my assigned seats...","Flew yesterday from Manchester to Orlando.

Flights out were fine but the flight back was not as our airplane was changed to a three three three configuration so our seats which were still 3A and 3B were so small in width we could only just sit in them and when our meal was brought round we could not put the tables down to eat our meals as the tables were in the armrests hence the reason the seats were not very wide.

5,1,2,1,6951,"My boyfriend and I made a trip to Spain(Hong Kong-Madrid and Madrid- Hong Kong). We flied with Aeroflot and had both trips scaling in Moscow. Both going(30th Aug) and coming back(15th Sep), the luggages were spot checked as the suitcase locks were open when we got the luggages back (which we think by Russia Airport Authority as this has never happened since I have transited and been traveling around to any other countries). The going trip to Spain, both suitcase locks were open, broken lock for my boyfriend's case which he bought a new suitcase in Spain later. However, the real disaster was actually the coming back trip!! When we picked up the luggage, we found out that both luggages were broken, there are also 2 breakage spots on my luggage itself, the luggage handle came off and the locks were totally forced broken(so my boyfriend lost totally 2 suitcases for this trip). I have locked them before check-in and my suitcase is the type that came with international lock that can be opened by international key in case the luggage would be spot checked by any airport authority so it should not be forced open in such manner! That aside, when we got home, I opened the luggage just to find out that the things inside were totally flipped over in a big mess! The zipped compartment inside was open and the clothes are all messed up(as messy as a 80% sale basket in the shopping mall), the wrapped present was torn open, wrapping paper and the pieces of present scattered around everywhere in the luggage. Furthermore, my boyfriend's mobile phone(old one with problem which we was thinking to get it fixed in China) and his suit (together with necktie and belt) were stolen! The box of mobile phone was left behind together with the torn open plastic suit bag but both of the items were no where to be found! I tried to call the airline but nobody picked up, now I'm waiting for the reply email which I don't know whether they will even cared to read. Frankly speaking, I have no hope that they will contact us back. So this post is only an example and a warning for you guys to be careful and choose the airline wisely (we bought it because it was the cheapest flight ticket, an obviously resulted as an expensive lesson).

5,1,2,1,6975,"I made the unfortunate mistake of booking an emergency trip to the UK thru Minneapolis to LGW with Northwest. In the past I always had good luck with MSP but apparently they have been in the midst of runway work and flights are delayed or cancelled willy nilly (although you can bet it's the smaller cities whose flights are cancelled), Couldn't get into Minn to connect with the UK flight and NW ""service"" was little help. Apparently this has been going on frequently, yesterday the flight got to Minn too late to make the connection. If we had been warned earlier in the day, we could have driven to MSP in 4 hours and made the connection. All NW would offer by phone was a late Thurs flight to Detroit that got into LGW on Friday far too late for us. This suggestion also made it clear that NW wasn't going to guarantee we would be able to get to MSP Thursday eiher. Luckily we listened to the business travelers in line and did not trust the info given by phone, so we stayed in line and the in-person clerk (who was also helping unload planes at the same time) was able to reroute us to get to LGW three hours earlier which gives us a good shot at making the services. It may take all of Thursday to get to Gatwick but at least it's a chance if it all goes well. To add insult to this, while on hold with NW, they were playing an ad offering bonus miles to fly into Msp!!! If they had any kind of conscience they would be warning potential passengers of the delays and they all should change their schedules to avoid these delays. Oh, but then they might lose business, better to have a captive angry passenger than no passenger at all. I have not flown United for quite a number of years since that summer period when they were also stranding passengers in Denver and Chicago. I'm afraid that I'll be avoiding NW, especially their Airlink, for at least that many years after this. I can't think of any other business that I have been lied to and manipulated by for years and years as much as by the airlines. There was a time when I really did enjoy traveling, but that was before the hubs, maximizing seat capacity, disappearance of snacks and cancelling flights to make sure the other flights have no empty seats.","I made the unfortunate mistake of booking an emergency trip to the UK thru Minneapolis to LGW with Northwest.

5,1,2,1,6981,"I was surprised to discover recently that I am only a few hundred miles away from Medallion Status on Delta. I say ""surprised"" because I generally don't fly enough in a year to get the necessary mileage for any kind of airline status. However in this case I benefited from a couple of trips to the west coast earlier in the year, plus two sizable MQM bonuses that I received courtesy of my Skymiles credit card. I have some long haul trips planned for later this year and early next, so decided to have a go at a Mileage Run to get the remaining miles for the status upgrade. Since I'm new to doing Mileage Runs, I decided to try something not too terribly ambitious - just enough miles to push me over the threshold. I've read that ATL is not a great airport to base out of for this sort of activity, but I did find an inexpensive R/T flight to Louisville that departs on a weekday afternoon, has a short layover at SDF, and then returns to ATL by about 8:00 PM on the same day. It cost about $145 altogether and I'll get 1000 miles out of it - not such a great deal in terms of cost per mile, but for a first effort I guess it's not too bad (plus it's a small financial investment if I have to back out at the last minute out for some reason). Anyway, here's my question. My biggest concern with this is that something will happen in Louisville (delays, etc) and I will miss the return flight to Atlanta. Both flights have the same flight number so I am guessing it's the same physical airplane for both legs. Does anyone have any idea if that's a valid assumption? I figure worst case I can do a one-way car rental and drive home (6 hours) if I miss the return, but would obviously rather fly (note that I only need the outgoing miles for the status upgrade, so no real harm done if that happens). That's really all I wanted to know, I guess. I know that FlyerTalk is probably a better venue to discuss this sort of thing, but I am not active over there (yet!). My wife is very dubious about all of this and thinks I am crazy, so I am just trying to allay some concerns.

When I made the purchase, I paid about $120 more than the least expensive fare I could find at the time because I had a preferred departure time and wanted a non-stop flight.

It is hardly the end of the world, and can manage with the change, but I feel like I am getting less than I paid for, as I could have purchased a similar itinerary for less money when I made the original reservation.

Peak times are between 9:00 a.m. to12:00 p.m., and 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Travelers are strongly encouraged to contact their respective carriers regarding any potential delays."" flysfo.com/web/…updates The dates listed are ... Jan. 11-14, Jan. 18-21, Jan. 25-28, April 5-8, April 12-15, April 19-22, April 26-29 , June 25-26 and and June 27-28 . Runways 28-L and 28-R are used for long haul takeoffs and for virtually all landings. The important point to note is that flights to SFO originating at an airport within a 2 hour flying time, will be subject to delays. These airports cover most of the west coast, from San Diego (SAN) in the south to Portland (PDX - my home) in the north. Seattle is a 2hr15 flight from SFO, so may not be immune. These delays already happen when bad weather hits SFO, as flights from nearby airports are subject to flow control. Should bad weather and these closures hit on the same day(s) it could be big time problems. If you have a flight to SFO and an onward connection for these dates, as referenced above you'd be advised to contact your airline. If you're planning on connecting via SFO from a nearby airport on these dates, allow an enormous amount of contingency, and even consider avoiding SFO altogether.",1891,0,1,1

So, I called them to see how they were going to handle it. They said a refund was not an option. Fine. Act of God, whatever. So they said they would rebook my flight at a different date but they were sold out until the end of the month. And oh, by the way, I would have to pay the difference between the original ticket price and they ticket price of a different date----which was $500 more than the original ticket price, because the only tickets they had available were during the high season. I think that's poor customer service, but okay. Fine. The guy said I had 10 months to redeem it. Well, I called back three weeks later to rebook it, and he said that I only had two days to rebook the flight, that time had passed, they were taking my money and they would not be giving it back. NO ONE told me this when I talked to them originally. They made it very clear I had up to ten months to rebook it at no charge except for any difference in the ticket price. I explained this and asked to speak to a manager or supervisor. The guy on the phone was *extremely* rude though I was trying to stay calm and cordial with him. I asked 4 times before he finally agreed to let me speak to a supervisor. At which time, he put me on hold and left me there for 45 minutes. Finally, I hung up and called back.

5,1,2,1,7224,"Here is the description of my terrible experience with FlightNetwork: I needed to book round trip tickets to Copenhagen for 3 people. We searched Google flights for the best deal and found a round trip flight for $843 from Flight Network. Since we needed to book using 3 different credit cards, I called FlightNetwork for the booking to ensure that we all get the same price and availability. First, it takes the agent forever to find the flight I am talking about (even using the flight numbers). Then, the agent tells me that the price I am seeing is due to a “glitch” in the system but they would honour this price. I am put on hold for long periods of time in order for the agent to come to this conclusion. It is already 30 minutes that I’m on the call and I have no new information other than the information I already had accessed online in less than 2 minutes. I tell the agent I would like to book with 3 credit cards and apply a promo code (for $20 discount per booking). The agent then asks me for the credit card numbers. Without asking me for my promo code, she has already applied a random promo code that gives $10 discount. I was frustrated at the incompetence of the agent and the long wait times so I decided I would continue the transaction online. I hang up with the agent, go through the online booking system, put in my credit card, click on “Purchase Now”, only to get a pop up that says the online system could not confirm my fare. I refresh the page and suddenly the flight is showing up at $896. I call back 5 minutes after I’ve hung up with the agent the first time, and she tells me that flight prices have gone up. I now decide to proceed with the booking anyway as it is urgent enough for me to book this flight. Another 45 minutes goes by, again long hold times, and my 3 flights are now booked. I receive emails with details of the booking but no invoice. I told myself I would call the next day to ask about the invoice. The next day, I notice the flight is showing at $843 again! And, on top of that, when I log in to the Air Canada website to manage my booking, the purchase price is actually at $843. So when I call back FlightNetwork, I tell them about this and I also tell them that I can’t even confirm what has been charged because I never received an invoice. Again, more ridiculously long hold times - every time, I ask a question, the agent tells me to hold on, puts me on hold for 5-10 minutes and comes back throwing up an answer she received from someone else. What is the point of customer care agents when they have to consult every question. Initially, the agent tells me that she says I was charged $843 mistakenly. I am so confused. Then, she comes back and says oh no, it was $896 that you were charged. Complete chaos!! She sends me the invoice which says that I am paying $285 for the flight and $611.57 in taxes totalling $896.57. Then I tell her that the flight is back to $843 on their website. She says she cannot see this price in their database. I am literally refreshing the page as I speak to the agent and am seeing $843. I had to send a screenshot of what I am seeing on their website to them to prove that I am seeing this price!! She then says that because the flight is book, she cannot refund the difference but can provide it as a credit due to their price drop protection. I was not satisfied with this but looked like I didn’t have another option so I agree and she tells me that it will appear in my account within 3-5 business days. It has been 4 and still nothing but we will see. During the call, I ask to speak with a supervisor and she tells me that the supervisor will basically tell me the same thing… The total time for this call was 1 hour. Then I finally see the charge on my credit card - I see 2 charges. One with the description AIR CANADA totalling $843 and another with description TASF totalling $53. I google TASF and find out this mean travel agent service fee. I am so furious now as they never informed me that this was part of the price they quoted to me!! It is not even detailed in the invoice. I tried calling and the agent tells me that this doesn’t need to be detailed to me, it is part of the total price but I am still not convinced. This is only $53 but the principle of the matter, I was not informed of the details of the charges to my credit card, let alone the absolutely horrible service, I am sure this is in violation of some consumer protection act or travel agents act. Overall absolutely terrible terrible nightmarish experience with FlightNetwork. Not worth the headache and lack of transparency. Embarrassing that this is a Canadian company.","Here is the description of my terrible experience with FlightNetwork: I needed to book round trip tickets to Copenhagen for 3 people.

We booked extra legroom seats and we felt the cost was worth it. Seat Selection: This was done online as well and it was simple. My only complaint is that we wanted two aisle seats and it wouldn't let me. Online Check in: I checked in a week ahead of time and printed boarding passes. Again, simple and easy. Night before luggage drop: We dropped off our luggage the night before with no stress or problems. I love being able to do this. Flight: Boarding was on time and very efficient. We did take off about 20 minutes later than planned. The flight was comfortable. We had bought a Boots Meal deal at the airport before we went to the plan. So, we did not purchase anything on the plane. We booked extra space seats and they were good value for my tall husband. The flight is about 3 hours from Manchester. Luggage & Immigration in Naples: we disembarked quickly upon landing to a bus. At immigration, the lines went quickly. We had a little wait for the luggage and then off to our transfer. From landing to our transport heading to Sorrento, it took about 1 1/2 hours. The return trip was just as simple and easy. We were pleased with our flights and now look forward to our trip on the Dreamliner this summer.","I thought I would share our experience. If you have any questions, please ask.

My wife and I just returned from a round trip via Delta from Charlotte to Jacksonville, FL. We flew first class cheaper than a coach seat on AA. From the moment we stepped up to the ticket counter in Charlotte until we got our baggage back at the end of the trip, it was amazing to experience the difference in service. The comparison between first class on Delta and first class on AA is amazing. Delta on each leg had chilled water bottles waiting at our seat, fresh blankets, pillows, and the flight attendants came down the aisle and took drink orders on the ground, and seamlessly replaced empty water bottles. Snacks were first rate and included fresh fruit and unique offerings. The entire crew was dressed very sharply, smiled, and actually thanked us for flying with them. They seemed to genuinely enjoy their jobs. Every flight on AA that we've taken since the merger we could hear the flight attendants complaining and they could care less about the service. Not once did passengers get berated by the flight attendants to hurry up so they could have an on time departure by the Delta crews....it is common place on AA. It was as if we stepped back in time when air travel was enjoyable. On each leg of the trip, our luggage was waiting on us when we arrived at baggage claim. AA is lucky to get it to you within 30 minutes. Best decision we've made to switch our business to Delta.","Since Usairways merger with American our service and prices have suffered out of Charlotte.

I wanted to double-check, so I called back a 3rd time, and the 3rd agent told me to put down the cost of the taxes and fees. In case of cancellation, I would get the taxes and fees back from BA. YIKES....]I don't know what to do now? Does anyone know for sure? [How do I avoid future trouble about this??? Thanks.]",1169,785,0.3284858854,0

Approximately six weeks later I received a letter saying I needed to complete a whole new form, this time in paper form. I contacted HMPO and asked why, since my application was complete and with no errors. They told me it was because I had missed Section 4 (details on parents). I went back into the online form, this time taking screen shots with date and time, and surprise, surprise there was no Section 4 in the online version of the form. I was never given the opportunity to write my parents details. I repeated the process several times in different dates and managed to get to the end of the form (screen to complete payment and submit).

I booked some flights and elected to pay by Direct Deposit to avoid the credit card surcharge. As my bank is the same as theirs the transaction was processed immediately. Two working days later when I checked my itinerary, it was flagged as pending, unpaid. As when I had originally made the payment it said that the booking would only be held for two days I was a little concerned and phoned their customer service department. When I eventually got through, after some discussion I was asked to send a copy of my bank's confirmation of payment, which I duly did. Later that day I found the itinerary was now marked as paid so I was happy enough with that. However, this morning a Jetstar rep called me to check that everything was now OK and ask if I had received my itinerary (which I had). Not only that, but she had to call four times before I was available to take the call, which I thought was pretty good follow up, I would have thought they'd give up after the second try. They did leave voice mail, but only to say they wanted to speak with me personally, so they also didn't take that out and call it good.

5,1,2,1,7456,"I have not flown internationally in a long time....or even domestically since the invention of the TSA. I therefore had some trepidation about the flight, figuring it would be a royal PITA, no food, and generally where the end would justify the means. Wrong. I chose British Airways Open Skies from Newark to Orly because I had always had good experiences with BA. Also, I liked the idea of a smaller plane with less people. It seemed to be a bit more civilized. I was not disappointed even though we traveled economy. The seats were leather and comfy, and not quite as narrow as some. Our seats were the first row in economy, so although not separated by a wall, there was a lot of leg space between our seats and the last row of business class. We were not treated as if we were the inferior class. We received iPads, a full meal which was quite good, as well as a small breakfast snack before landing...all at no additional cost. Upon the return we were two in three seats, which was terrific. We had a sizable snack, a full meal which was also quite good and another snack prior to landing. The flight crew (captain et al) on both flights were terrific....informative and very personable. The flight attendants were very pleasant, professional and helpful...and love the uniforms as they have a chic retro vibe. Along with the pillow and blanket we received a packet with eye shades, socks, and another item I can't recall. Boarding and disembarking were both a breeze although upon Orly arrival we did not have jetway access but had to disembark on the airfield where a bus waited to take us to the terminal. On the return to Newark we hit a wind shear upon touch down which the female pilot handled very admirably. Luggage retrieval was painless...again, due to far fewer passengers. One point...the 757-200 is a narrow body jet. Therefore the aisles are narrower than many other types of aircraft. Therefore, any bump in the air will cause you to bump the passenger in the seat if walking in the aisle, or be bumped if you are seated. Other than that, the flight was like flying used to be, when passengers were treated like humans, and not cattle. IMO, all,others airlines should,take a page out of the BAOS book. I would fly them again in a heartbeat. Now all they need to add is in flight WiFi, and the service would be perfect.","I have not flown internationally in a long time....or even domestically since the invention of the TSA.

All flights and airlines have been great - even EasyJet (!) - with the glaring exception of British Airways.

I want to make sure you know I'm not one of those people. When booking my trip I did request assistance from Allegiant with my luggage, moving through the airport and security, to the gate, and on and off the plane. I tried to be as specific as possible as to the assistance I needed since I was traveling alone. These requests were not out of line and should have all been provided by Allegiant. Instead, Allegiant asked my family member who was dropping me off at the airport to help me to my gate which was a huge inconvieniece for them. On my first leg the gate was changed before the flight and another passenger had to move me to the new gate. But that was nothing compared to how I found my wheelchair every time I received it back from Allegiant after landing. After the first leg, the left arm rest was broken off. I didn't say anything at that time thinking that it was just a ""things happen"" situation. I really lost it though when at the end of my second leg, as I was being wheeled down the ramp, the young man who was wheeling me down wheeled my left wheel partially on the edge of the ramp causing the rubber tire to come off my wheel!! Then he started telling me how it was ""normal wear and tear"". REALLY?!?! When my husband and I got back to our car we inspected the chair closer and found that the edge of the back of the chair had a rip in the vinyl!! It's going to cost me more to repair this chair than it will to just replace it. What makes me so angry is that no one says sorry. My husband worked for an entire day to make this chair fit my personality by painting it sparkly hot pink since I have to spend so much time in it. Now though, I'm house bound because they just didn't care to take care of something that is so important to me.

5,1,2,1,10516,For anyone on here that may have been on this delayed flight on 18th September from Manchester to Rhodes I have just successfully claimed compensation through Thomas Cook. The only information I sent them was a standard letter which you can find the template for on moneysavingexpert.com. I had the original eticket from my email inbox but no other information ie boarding passes etc so if you do decide to try and claim this should be the only thing you need to attach to the letter. Also they did send me an email with an offer of a voucher to be redeemed on a future Thomas cook holiday (expires in 12 months) but as I am unable to do that I have asked them to send me a cheque which you are legally entitled to do. From sending the letter to receiving the email today it only took 13 days for a resolution. Good luck if you decide to go for it. :-),For anyone on here that may have been on this delayed flight on 18th September from Manchester to Rhodes I have just successfully claimed compensation through Thomas Cook.

Prior to take off in Perth we were joined in the row in front of us by 3 drunk men who from that moment on set about drinking the cabin dry. After an hour, the one in front of my wife suddenly decided to put his seat into a full recline position hitting my wife in the face. We complained and verbal hostilities arose. We were moved 5 rows back. This was not the end of our troubles. From that point onwards we were threatened contiunally by these men. This was pointed out to the crew. Approaching to land I was told by ""the leader"" that they would be waiting for me in the corridor. This was heard by a Stewardess. A terrifying experience all round. Nothing happened in the corridor but we were on edge continually. Luckily for us, they did not continue on our joining flight to Heathrow. I emailed a complaint to Malaysia Airways and 4 weeks later they have replied sending a 3 line email back saying thanks for my observations and they will review their practices on future flights. The questions is. Do I now leave it at that or is that the best I can expect from a 5 star airline ?????","My wife and I recently boarded a Malaysia Airlines flight from Perth to Kualar Lumpar.
